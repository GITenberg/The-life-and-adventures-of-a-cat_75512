<p class="drop-cap">It has been ever a sage remark
of the wisest philosophers,
that all creatures
bear about them the criterion of
their peculiar nature: Such as the
ferocity of the Lyon, the grimness
of the Tyger, the cunning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Fox: Among the animals who boast
of gravity, none can pretend to that
sedateness which the <i>Cat</i>, on first view,
arrogates to itself above all others.
The <i>Owl</i>, indeed, has time immemorial,
dared to enter the lists, and
therefore was by the ignorant ancients,
dedicated to <i>Minerva</i>, the
goddess of <i>Wisdom</i>, but whether the
Owl’s letters patent were ever made
out for that title, is a question,
which must be decided by the more
learned,</p>

<p class="noindent">The Ass too has had the assurance,
to throw down his gauntlet in this
tournament, tho’ with no better a
face than his competitor, the bird<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of <i>Minerva</i>. But what person, tho’
ever so little inclined, to the talents
of observation, could possibly avoid
taking notice of the uncommon <i>prudery</i>
of the <i>Cat</i>. He, or she, male,
or female, shall take their post
close by a fire side, with all the conformity,
with all that respectable
quality, which should entitle him
or her to a notable attention. Nay
the old ladies, vulgarly called old
women, have been so hardy as to
say, that Cats are witches, that
they can prognosticate, foretell, predict,
and what not? and it is affirmed
by some of those venerable
matrons, that a cat has made an
Almanack. I have heard indeed,
and with some aspect of credibility,
that a Cat is something barometrical,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
or in plainer terms bears a resemblance
to a weather glass; that
when she washes her face, it is a
sign of good weather, and when
she is in her frolicks, it will blow
hard, but how to attest these diagnostic
symptoms is above our capacity,
and even Pliny himself the
natural historian would be puzzled
to decide a matter of such consequence.</p>

<p>To possess two qualities eminently
distinct, is the inheritance of no
creature upon earth. The Dog is
faithful, vigilant, docile, and of an
excellent scent. The Horse boasts of
many virtues, and amiable endowments;
his speed, his strength and
other illustrious talents recommend
him to man: So of other animals;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
but none of these enumerates good
qualities diametrically opposite each
other. Now in the Cat, there
appears the utmost austerity, with
the greatest levity. A rake and a
senator are most wonderfully compounded.
Who can analize these
differing ingredients, so demure
a puritan on a sudden, converted
into the most absolute debauchè?
One time sitting for four
or five hours in the attitude of solemnity,
and then on sudden break
out into the most dissolute festivity.
These qualities, so dissonant, so very opposite
to each other, must indicate
something superior in the
animal, whose history we are at
present writing, and we think we
have proved this superiority of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Cat above all other animals so incontestibly,
that all historians, ancient
and modern, must submit to
our sublime decree, or else confute
our at present irrefragable argument
in some future treatise.</p>

<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>Of the Lyon</i>, &amp;c.</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Nature has bestowed in the
distribution of her various gifts,
some characterestic badge to every
animal, by which they know and are
known to each other; and by which
they are conversible with, or envious
to one another. Sociability, or
the love of herding, is not so peculiar
to man, as man would boast.
Lyons, horses, dogs, Cats, and the
other species are as fond of forming
colonies as we are. And yet in contradistinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
to this principle, we
see the Lion chase the <i>Jack-all</i> for his
caterer. The <i>Jack-all</i>, says <i>Pliny</i>, is
endowed with the most excellent
nose to investigate the paths of those
weak, or timorous beasts, which are
the Lion’s prey. This scent renders
him the more useful to his friend
the <i>Lyon</i>, whom he <i>leads by the nose</i>
to a herd of deer or oxen. The
Lyon, wanting this fine scent, and
convinced of his deficience, takes
into his familiarity, and confidence,
this weak animal, who makes use
of the other’s strength, and from his
own inability in personal prowess,
compensates the loss by the admirable
organization of his odorific nerves.
Thus, in like manner, the Pilot-fish
conveys the Shark to his prey: And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
I have read in some learned antiquary
of a bird, called the <i>Tooth-pick</i>,
which lives on the leavings of
the <i>Crocodile</i>, who having filled his
belly with what fish he can pick up
in the <i>Nile</i>, lies on his back, on the
banks of that river, and basks himself
with delight, while this bird,
guided by instinct, and no way afraid
of his terrors, perches on his
teeth, and from the gleanings feeds
himself to satiety. We ought not
in this detail omit to take notice of
the <i>Fly-eater</i>, who puts his tongue
out, till several thousand flies, have
in swarms covered it, and when he
perceives it to be pretty well stocked,
all on a sudden introduces the
cargo, where it is fairly entered;
and this trick he plays for several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
hours, till the custom-house can
hold no more.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">There are few people but
have either seen or heard
of the <i>learned Dog, <span lang="fr">Le Chien Scavant</span></i>,
and yet his uncommon knowledge,
except we should now record
it, will appear incredible to
posterity. He could read, write, and
figure, play cards, spell any person’s
names, with many other parts
in useful knowledge; and, as <i>Hudibras</i>
says,</p>

<p class="noindent">We have heard of a dog who saved
money, and lent it out to usury; of
a horse that would usually of a
morning go out a hunting with the
hounds; of the Elephant there are
many strange accounts, among the
rest of his surprising gratitude and
love for his keeper, his vast memory,
and retention, and his understanding
the language of those among
whom he is reared; I say,
these and more excellencies of the
several creatures are to be found all
concentered in the Cat, therefore
expecting an implicit belief to
all we have advanced, concerning
this most sagacious of all sagacious
animals, we shall immediately
enter upon, and to our
history, still reserving to ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the honour of having said nothing
but was necessary to introduce our
hero into the world.</p>

<br>
<span class="lsp0 fs80">Tom <i>the Cat is born of poor but
honest parents. His mother dies
in child-bed, his brothers and sisters,
to the number of nine are sent adrift,
and drowned.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy"><i>Mab</i>, the mother of <i>Tom</i>, was
left a widow by a former husband,
who had left behind him no
great means to support her, and therefore
she wisely thought it the best expedient
she could make use of to
change her condition once more, and
enter into the state of matrimony.
We are left in the dark, as to the
person who performed the ceremony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
nor are we certain, whether the
<i>Feline</i> gentleman who tied them
together, was regularly qualified to
do his office, but he discharged it to
the great satisfaction of both parties;
though some are malicious enough
to insinuate, that he went snacks
with the bridegroom that very night,
who not having it in his power to
provide a wedding-supper, is reported
by the best historians, to have
left his wife in very unuxorious manner
to run after a Rat, which served
him for supper. Now as it is
a wise child that knows his own father,
so we dare not insist upon
<i>Tom’s</i> being the lawful issue of <i>Mowser</i>,
or the spurious child of the
parson; be that as it will, he was
brought into this troublesome world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
on the 29th. day of <i>September</i>, a
day memorable for the perplexity
which the generality of tenants are
in, to find or raise money to pay
their rents. On account of this day
on which he was born, several of
his father’s friends were for having
him called <i>Michael</i>, but more solid
arguments, which we never heard,
being offered, he was called <i>Tom</i>.
His poor mother having born nine
helpless children beside himself, and
being exhausted in spirits, by the
hard labour which she underwent,
expired in the company of the midwife,
and some other good neighbours,
of the Feline species, who
performed their last office, and buried
her in an adjacent Dunghill. Mab’s
Mistress was seeking her, and having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
called to no purpose, found ten
very fine bantlings lying under the
bed, nine of which she drowned,
and saved one, who happened to be
our illustrious Hero, she took the
care of Tom on herself, intending
he should spend his days with her in
regard to his mother Mab, of whom
she never could get any tidings ever
after; she did not care to put him
out to nurse, having heard so many
sad stories of those nurses daily employed
to supply the foundling Hospital,
and therefore she determined,
to nurse him herself. This is the
truest account we could collect from
the best authors, concerning his
birth; as to his genealogy, we did
examine into that, and to that end
ransacked several circulating libraries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
for Welch records, which we traced
backwards even to the Cat of Whittington,
but found nothing that we
dared advance as truth, for we scorn
to impose upon our readers, with reports
or facts, which we cannot vouch
for. Nevertheless we make no question,
but Tom’s parents, by father
and mother’s side, could put in their
claim to as high a descent, in Feline
genealogy as Whittinton’s Cat, or
the famous Cat of Montaigne, who
laughed at her Master for being such
a fool, as to spend his time in playing
with her, and actually told him
so, or Montaigne himself is a liar,
who very gravely reports it for
truth in some of his essays.</p>

<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>Tom</i>’s <i>Education.—His Manner of
Life with his Mistress, whose History
is introduced here in a short Narrative.</i></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">It was Tom’s peculiar beauty, and
size that saved his life, for his
Mistress <i>had Eyes</i>, and chose him out
of ten, so that he was a kind of <i>tythe
Cat</i>, and survived the unhappy fate
of his brothers, and sisters by decimation,
proving to the disgrace of Methodists,
that even among Cats, one in
ten may be saved, though according
to their illustrious tenets, that will
not be the portion of one in ten of
themselves. However Tom grew up
and gave earnest of being a most
promising youth, having gone thro’
all the gambols and feats of childhood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
peculiar to those of his kind,
and to the great satisfaction of all
who knew him, or had the honour
of his acquaintance.—His Mistress,
however was inexcuseable in point of
tenderness, who not being sufficiently
pleased with his beauty, thought
the cutting off his Ears would be an
abundant addition to that article;
a barbarous instance of her love for
him, but in consequence of her
resolution Tom lost his Ears, for
having done no crime to deserve
amputation, when thousands walk
the Streets with their ears on, who
have a thousand times deserved to
lose them. His mistress, whose name
was Mrs. Clotilda-Skin-Flint, began
to take another more cruel thought
into her head, and that was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
deprive him of his manhood, by
equipping him for the Opera, and was
advised to put this dreadful scheme
into execution by a female neighbour
of hers, called <i>Rugana</i>, but
as this was as troublesome as it was
expensive, she permitted him to keep
his pebbles, as marks of that virility,
which he afterwards testified
to several young Cats of his acquaintance.—Whether
Tom ever came to the knowledge of this sanguinary
intent of his Mistress, we
never could learn, if he did, he must
no doubt be sensibly affected with
delight to find, that by its being laid
aside, he found himself in possession
of that treasure which entitled him
to the honourable appellation of <i>Ram-Cat</i>.
His mistress, after having bred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
him up to feed himself, and to provide
for his own sustenance, left him
to shift for the necessaries of life,
by all those means, which most of
his kind make use of to get a livelyhood,
namely by <i>Mouseing</i>, and having
before he was half a year old,
rid not only her house, but that
neighbourhood of the rats and
mice which infested them, he bore
the credit of being an excellent mowser,
for he got no other reward,
and was forced for sometime to live
upon that empty saying, <i>Virtue is its
own Reward</i>, verifying that fine
anecdote of <i>Juvenal</i>, <i lang="la">Ladatum Virtus
et alget</i>, which for the sake of our
English Reader, we will suppose to
signify, that <i>a good or a wise man may
starve in the midst of Fleet-Market,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
for any thing he is likely to get from
either fools or knaves</i>. Mrs. Clotilda-Skin-Flint,
was one of those
admirable ladies, who go in quest
of obsolete robes, and had raised a
tolerable sum by levying contributions
on the necessitous, who where
glad to part with their vestments for
the tenth part of their intrinsic value:
she had, to make her own employment
more lucrative, wedded an
old taylor, whom she married purely
on the account of his dexterity and
skill in, or repairing the breaches
of old clothes, and making them
pass for new: by this profitable business
she was enabled to keep a very
sightly shop in the purlieus of Monmouth-Street,
and was by her lending
out small sums of money to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
butchers, who dealt with her at an
extravagant usury, in possession of
five hundred pounds in money and
stock.</p>

<p>Tom did not approve of his Mistress’s
niggarly temper, and though
he made several attempts upon her
larder, he seldom availed himself of
the expedition, being glad to get off
with whole bones, he being a rival
in these purloinings with the old
taylor, his master, who was as
narrowly watched as himself in these
kind of invasions, and whom his
wife had starved, cudgel’d, and
cuckolded into the bargain. However,
one day, Tom laid a plot, and
being determined to assuage the cries
of hunger, he resolutely attacked two
pound of beef-stakes, which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
contrary to former caution left to
his mercy, as the mistress had indulged
herself too plentifully with
the ratifai of St. <i>Giles</i>’s, commonly
called <i>Gin</i>. The maid had been absent
by accident, at the time of this
depredation, Tom prudently withdrew,
when he had eat up his delicious
cates, and left the blame to
fall upon either the maid, or the old
taylor, the former of which fasted
that day for her negligence, and was
discharged without payment of her
wages, while old snip had like to
have been destroyed by the weight
of the goose, with which his tender
rib did belabour him to his no small
mortification, and of which he lay
ill for three days to his wife’s utter
discontent, as she was forced to hire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
a journeyman to finish some work
he had begun.</p>

<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>The Maid Servant takes out a warrant
against Tom: He is arrested,
and put into a Jail, where he is
forced to pay garnish.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">The maid servant being thus
deprived of her wages by her
rapacious mistress, and knowing that
ridicule would be the best method
to expose her, went to a bailiff, a
relation of her own, and told him
the case, adding, that she thought
the nearest way to obtain an effectual
remedy both for her wages and her
private satisfaction, was to expose
her mistress by some stroke of ridicule,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
which would be matter of
laughter to all the neighbours, who
hated her for her avarice and rapine,
and that a comical revenge had
struck into her head on a sudden,
which she determined that very day,
with his assistance to put into execution,
he promised not only to give
her the best assistance in his power,
but also to be himself the instrument
of her immediate revenge, whereupon
she asked him if he would
take upon him to arrest the Cat,
who by eating the beef stakes, had
been the occasion of her being deprived
of her place, together with
her wages; she owned that she had
no particular pique of resentment
against the Cat, who had been for
many weeks a fellow sufferer with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
herself in the article of starving, and
she protested that she would have
done the same had she been a Cat, but
as she was a Woman, and not used
to eat raw beef, she therefore had
never thought of stealing them; that
it often happened, she used to steal
a slice of bread and cheese for her
poor old master, whom her barbarous
mistress had also locked up the
victuals from, and that she had run
the risque to serve him, though his
wife had privately marked the bread
and cheese. Certainly said the bailiff,
your cause is just, and you have
sufficient reason to complain. There
is no law why a Cat may or may not
be taken for theft; horses are subject
to be impounded, and so are cows,
sheep and pigs liable to imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
for misdemeanors of this nature;
therefore as no law exists why
your fellow servant should not be
arrested, I will take it upon my self
to make out his <i>Mittimus</i>, and if his
mistress thinks fit to remove him by
<i lang="la">habeas Corpus</i>, she may, but it shall cost
her something, besides the procuring
you your wages; I don’t regard, says
the girl, my wages so much as my
private revenge to have her exposed
to her neighbours. That, answered
the bailiff, shall be done, for I will
have a whole posse of constables with
me, and we will beset the house,
and take her favourite before the
whole street. They parted, she to
observe the execution of her comical
revenge, and he to raise the posse.</p>

<p>It was about the meridian hour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
when the Sun is vertical over the
heads of mortals, in plain English,
it was about twelve o’clock high
noon, when the bailiff appeared with
his frightful posse of scare-crows,
and beset the shop, to the utter dismay
and consternation of the inhabitants
of the wardrobe in <i>Monmouth-street</i>.
Mrs. <i>Clotilda Skinflint</i>, and
her Cornutus, had just sat down to
a pig’s foot and vinegar, (which was
the portion allotted for her spouse’s
dinner,) two roasted pigeons, with
toast and butter, being laid before
herself, with a pint of that beer
commonly called porter, while a
pint of <i>Adam</i>’s ale, was very likely
thought good enough to allay the
thirst of her journeyman spouse and
yoke-fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><i>Tom</i> never dreamed of any prosecution
in law being carried on against
him, and therefore was purring
an inoffensive song, in expectation
of the skeleton of the pigeons,
a leg of which he was cranching with
sensible delight, when he was interrupted
by the entrance of one of
the bailiffs, who was followed by
several others, who secured the
person of <i>Tom</i>, and another shewed
the warrant, that they might not be
accused of doing any thing illegal,
or contrary to form, and while some
of them remained to explain the nature
and legality of this seizure, he
who made the caption, carried him
to the first prison which came in his
way, and delivered him into <i>Salva<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Custoda</i>, under the name of <i>Tom Filch</i>,
at the same time giving the goaler
and the other prisoners, a facetious
and short narrative of the whole affair,
and the history of the parties
concerned. When the prisoners discovered,
that it was all a piece of
waggery, they entered hastily into
the joke, and hearing that <i>Tom</i> the
prisoner was the favourite particular
of a substantial house-keeper,
who would in all probability release
him by paying his fees; they boldly
and with one voice demanded garnish
of <i>Tom</i>, who not being used to
such questions from strangers, did
not think proper to answer them.
Now, if they had according to the
custom of garnish, threatened to
strip him, <i>What could they have of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Cat but his Skin?</i> But as he made no
answer to their previous question,
they thought it more adviseable to
lock him in a dark cell, and called
for ale, which for the joke’s sake,
was not denied them in so unprecedented
a garnish, and they sat down
to regale themselves, where we shall
leave them in order to finish this
chapter and begin another.</p>

his; in compliance therefore of this
reasonable demand: <i>Tom Traveller</i>,
so he was called, commenced his
history in the following procedure.</p>


<h3><span class="lsp0"><i>The</i></span> LIFE <span class="lsp0"><i>of</i></span> <span class="smcap">Tom Traveller</span>.</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">As I was begot, conceived and
born in a most extraordinary
manner, so it will appear in the
course of my life, that my adventures,
even in abstract, as I shall relate
them, have been equally amazing.
My mother was treacherously
deluded by an opiate infused into a
glass of wine, when she had the good
or ill-fortune (I know not which)
of being debauched in her sleep by
her master, the husband of a woman
of quality with whom she lived;
I was the result of this piece of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
treachery; nor did my mother give
the least intimations of her discovering
this foul practice, though she on
awaking, could not but <ins class="corr" id="tn-34" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'perceive the the'">
perceive the</ins> alteration from that of a maid,
to that of a woman. When she had
got rid of me in the most private
manner, (for she left her lady, when
the signs of pregnancy appeared) she
took me wrapt up in a basket, and
going to a publick house in <i>Piccadilly</i>,
she called for a gill of wine, drank
it, and leaving a guinea to be changed,
she went out and was seen no more,
but she left me in her stead, thinking
me and the guinea, a tolerable
bargain for a gill of wine, nor had I
remained there long, before I made
my host of the tavern, sensible, that
he had got a new guest; as I was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
fine boy, and he had no child, he
put me out to nurse, resolving to
adopt me as his own, since I was a
<i>comeby</i>-chance, and since he thought
it cruel not to give the same reception
to a human creature, as is given
commonly to a Cat or a Dog, and tho’
I did not come of my own accord, like
a Cat, or a Dog, yet was I brought, and
could not be supposed to intrude myself,
as those creatures do, when
they have lost their masters, so he
thought me more worthy of a welcome,
than either of the above animals.
When I was five years old,
I was brought home by the nurse,
and as they saw I was a promising
child of my age, being as lusty and
tall, as the waiter, who was twelve,
but born a dwarf, I was soon fit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
be called to the bar, I improved myself
in observations on men, and
manners, which I made my study,
till about eighteen, I became one of
the knowing ones, when I left my
supposed father, to join a set of
gamblers, where I learnt every thing
to qualify me for Bath, the races, or
even Ar——r’s. I resolved to leave
this life, took the high-road, and
bought a fine horse at Newmarket
with what money I had won there
by betting and cheating, having at
one bett won a hundred guineas of
the D—— of ——, as I was let
into the secret by the riding jocky,
who went halves with me for his information.
Having equipt myself
with every thing necessary for <i>collecting</i>,
or raising contributions on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the road, I met with none who
dared oppose me; I robbed three
captains of ships, one admiral, two
lieutenants of marines, beside what
I robbed in common; when I found
that all men were naturally cowards,
and consequently to be robbed, without
resistance, I grew more bold;
but what gave me courage but their
cowardice, for had they, as they said,
strenuously opposed, ’tis ten to one,
as I opposed numbers, I should have
grown timid, and submitted; but I
found it otherwise, and from the
discovery, met with success; I then
ventured upon the continental gentlemen;
but them I found worse in
the article of courage, than the maritime;
a lieutenant crossed me, and
I thought verily, he had the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
intent on me, that I had on him; I
put my hand to the holsters, and
stood bravely for him, but he with
as much intrepidity delivered me his
purse, before I had actually demanded
it: Actuated by this hero’s valour,
I persuaded myself that all men were
cowards, and, I consequently determined
to <i>frighten</i> them all, since I
found, they were to be <i>frightened</i>.
Here the narrative was interrupted
by a loud report of six or seven female
Voices, that Mrs. <i>Clotilda Skinflint</i>,
together with her <i>Bravo</i>, the
old husband had entered the goal, to
demand the body of Tom, to be
re-delivered to them, upon which
re-delivery, she was willing to pay all
costs and damages, which by this
time amounted to no less than three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
shillings, exclusive of garnish. And
so ends this chapter, when the affairs
of <i>Tom the Cat</i>, shall seem more desirable
by the reader, than those of
<i>Tom the Traveller</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">The turnkey no sooner had admitted
Mrs. <i>Clotilda</i>, and her
paramour, than the knowing ones
resolved themselves into a committee
of the whole house, how to consider
ways and means to make Mrs.
<i>Clotilda</i> pay through the nose for introducing
such an affair to their august
tribunal; the <i>Diet</i> had not sat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
full two minutes, before they all
<abbr lang="la" title="nemine contradicente"><i>nem. con.</i></abbr> entered into one unanimous
resolution to bring the taylor her
lawful and wedded husband into a
præmunire; they therefore set up a
kind of a Star-Chamber, which they
erected, by their own will and power,
as <i>Charles</i> did <i>formerly</i> and as <i>Lewis</i>
pretends to do <i>now</i>, with this Motto,
<i lang="la">Sic volo sic jubeo</i>. In English,
<i>I’ll do as I please</i>; so laying aside all
<i>privileges</i> of the subject, and assuming
to themselves, the <i>royal prerogative</i>,
which they swore should not
be infringed; they demanded that
the bodies of <i>Clotilda Skinflint</i> late of
<i>Monmouth-Street</i>, together with that
of her lawful sovereign, <i>Peter Skinflint</i>,
of the Parish of St. <i>Bride</i>’s,
taylor, should be brought before them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
in order to enter into the merits or
demerits of the prisoner <i>Tom</i>, committed
into that prison, by the name
of <i>Tom Filch</i>, and moreover to demand
the committal in writing;
which being accordingly done, by
the especial messengers, the delinquents
were regularly brought to the
bar of this solemn inquisition.</p>

<p>We shall disappoint the reader’s
curiosity, if he expects a summary
detail of this process, because it was
carried regularly through the forms
of cital, and recital, demur, and
every other circumstantial querk of
judicatory; only observing, that when
Mrs. <i>Clotilda</i>, and her party, seeing
the <i>Servant Maid</i>, with <i>Tom</i> in her
arms, did not chuse to traverse the
<i>Indictment</i> but submitted to the sentence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of the court, which was, that
she, the said, <i>Clotilda</i> as she <i>wore the
breeches</i>, should immediately pay all
the fees of <i>Tom</i>, besides, his expences
for <i>false imprisonment</i>, pay the
servant maid her due wages, and
never more trouble the court, to
which she submitted, and paid no
less than the sum of seventeen shillings,
and four-pence, to the clerk
of the court, exclusive of the girl’s
wages, in all amounting to one
pound thirteen shillings. But unhappily
for Mrs. <i>Clotilda</i>, the affair
did not end here. <i>Tom the Cat</i>, had
got little or no victuals, since the
moment of his false imprisonment,
and besides, it was urged by the
girl, that the beef-stakes, which he
had eaten, were long since digested;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
therefore it was <i lang="la">unâ voce</i> resolved,
that they should not be discharged
till <i>Tom</i> had also been recompensed
with a good meal, in consideration
of his long and false imprisonment.
Mrs. <i>Clotilda</i> therefore offered one
shilling more, to be laid out, as they,
the court should determine, which
was accordingly, like all other subsidies
of charitable uses, appointed
for <i>Tom</i>’s use, and bread, and cheese
was to be his supper, of which he
only shared the parings. The lady
of the wardrobe having paid down
her one pound fourteen shillings,
thought that she had paid sufficiently
for the releasement of her favourite
<i>Tom</i>, who in the main had not got
one half-penny worth of eating in
the bargain, and as historians say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
could never account from that time
to this, for all this unnecessary expence,
and as fruitless confinement;
I say, madam <i>Skinflint</i> imagined that
the business would end here; but the
court thought otherwise, and therefore
as the parings of cheese were
by that wise <i>Diet</i>, thought to be a
<i>diet</i>, which might very probably occasion
<i>thirst</i>, they also adjudged that
<i>Tom</i> should have something to wash
down his victuals, and the verdict
in his favour, was that she should
pay one shilling, over and above all
costs and damages for that balsamic
liquor, vulgarly called <i>Gin</i>: Which
Mrs. <i>Clotilda</i>, being addicted to, did
not so much regret the payment
of, and it was, without hesitation
brought in; but we never were informed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
that <i>Tom</i> shared a drop of it,
as it is averred, and that strongly, that
a little water was more consentaneous
to his choice, of which, when he
had drank, like any other good fellow,
not considering his present
misfortunes, the good-nature of his
friends, or the malice of his enemies,
he leaped on the table, washed
his face, and began a very solemn
purr, which pleased the whole company,
and forced even the humane
Mrs. <i>Clotilda</i> to break out—<i>Poor</i>
Tom <i>have I got you again? Gentlemen
did you ever see so fine a creature?</i>
Thus ended the imprisonment, and
release of <i>Tom</i>, with which we shall
beg leave to end this chapter, as Mrs.
<i>Clotilda</i> her husband, and the maid-servant
were also included in the discharge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
all departing the prison-scene,
and going to their respective

<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>The surprizing Adventures of Tom
Traveller are continued in this
Chapter.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">The happiest dexterity and
the greatest activeness in an
author, is to give his reader a specimen
of his talents, to introduce
a pleasing narrative, and when he
has worked up his curiosity to the
highest pitch, to leave him in the
middle of a most interesting event.
This was the peculiar cunning of
those famous stories, which go by
the name of the Arabian night’s entertainments,
which are for that reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
divided into a century of nights,
each being employed in some very
engaging tale. A late celebrated
Biographer has followed this ingenious
method, and now and then diverts
the reader with a curious history,
I mean the author of Tom
Jones, and Joseph Andrews, in which
several other adventures beside that
of the hero, are artfully interwoven,
which at once displays a delightful
variety, feasts the mental appetite
with a pleasing desert, which otherwise
might be apt to cloy by feeding
on one dish, though ever so delicate;
for this reason that celebrated writer,
entitles the heads of his chapters a
bill of fare, which points out to them
the ensuing entertainment. We shall
not therefore disappoint our reader,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
but shall, to answer the expectation,
which we are sensible we have raised,
proceed with the history of <i>Tom
Traveller</i>, forbidding all compilers
whatsoever, to insert, or abstract this
unparallel’d history in their future
collections of voyages, travels, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Tom the Cat</i>, was no sooner gone
home with his benevolent Mistress,
than <i>Tom Traveller</i>, at the importunity
of <i>Hugh</i> of the <i>Borough</i>, continued
his narrative.</p>

<p>My courage encreased, as I said,
with my success, and having obliged
those terraqueous militants to stand
and deliver, I found my purse grow
heavy, and believing I had made a
competent fortune, I resolved, as
<i>Gibbet</i> says in the play, to buy myself
a place in the houshold, and live<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
as snug as ’ere a courtier of them all;
with this view I was returning to
<i>London</i>, from <i>Finchley Common</i>,
which had been my last stage, when
a gentleman rode up in a full gallop
saying he was pursued by a highwayman,
and desired me to accompany
him in order to get out of the road.
In the confusion I was in, at his
mentioning being pursued, I began
to fear for myself, and looking back
saw two men, riding very fast after
us, yet not so fast as to appear in
pursuit, however I took the gentleman’s
advice, and rode with him full
speed, following the course he made
which he directed to the right hand,
from the high road across the country,
when all of a sudden he snatched my
reins, and desired me to deliver, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
he would blow my brains to the
Devil; I had neither time nor presence
of mind, to refuse his unreasonable
request, and he robbed me
of all I had in the world, except
twenty pounds I had left with a favourite
girl, whom I then kept,
after this he rode off, taking my
pistols with him, leaving me to reflect
on so unexpected an adventure;
but I had no opportunity to consider
much about it. I had no cash left,
and I found myself in possession of
no property on the face of the earth,
but my horse and clothes, the former
of which I was now resolved to sell,
and never more venture my life to
scrape up riches for other people to
enjoy; I saw the hazard, the danger,
and the folly in it, and with this determination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
I pursued my way to
<i>London</i>, saying with Juvenal, <i lang="la">Cantabit
Vacuus Viator</i>; where I arrived,
and having sold my horse, walked to
my lodgings, where to my amazement
I found the bird flown, and nothing
but the nest, and a few scattered
feathers left behind. Thus in
one day was I deprived of what I had
been amassing for several months, to
the value of three hundred pounds
sterling, one hundred of which I
laid out on my mistress in cloaths
and equipage. I had cultivated a
good acquaintance with several young
Gentlemen (strangers to my new
way of life) at <i>Art——rs</i>, and telling
them I had a mind to see the
world, made it my request to them
to serve me.</p>

my guilt, which when I recovered
myself, I imputed to the sudden
surprize of my being accused of a
crime which never had entered into
my thoughts. Enraged at the denial,
he said I was an infamous lying
villain, and struck me, which made
my nose spout out with blood. My
friend told him calmly, he might be
mistaken in faces, but he insisted on
his perfect knowledge of my person,
and said he could safely swear to my
identity; while I was stopping the
blood, which flowed in streams about
the room, he explained the particulars
of this robbery to my friend;
urging that I was not satisfied with
his money but would have his watch,
which more incensed him than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
loss of the money. Sir, said he, I
am sorry to find that you could have
any connections with such a fellow,
but more so to recommend a robber
to be my servant. <i>When he had won
my money</i>, said he,—at these words
it is inexpressible to describe the tide
of rapture, that flowed upon my affrighted,
my terrified soul; such is
a reprieve to a condemned wretch in
sight of the place of execution. He
proceeded,—when he had won my
money, he baited me with all the
tricks and insinuations of a common
gambler, and seeing my watch said,
if I would stake that he would venture
twice the money it was worth;
so unequal a hazard took me in, and
I thought I possibly might win all
again; he won it and left me abruptly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
when he went out, another person
came in, of my acquaintance, who
seeing me in some confusion asked
me the reason, which I instantly told
him; nay said my acquaintance, if
you keep company with known
gamblers, how can you expect better?
I replyed, I did not know him
to be such, or should have avoided
him. This, Sir, is the case, I never
saw this fellow since, and now I have
secured him by this accident, I’ll
send him to Newgate to be made an
example of, my friend remonstrated
in my favour, that he had known
me for a long time, and never knew
me to bear any such character, that
what the person who came in said
might be out of pique, that he did not
pretend to be my advocate in a cause,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
wherein I might possibly be innocent;
but that his stirring in such an
affair might hurt reputation on both
sides. I then spoke for myself, assuring
him I had ever played on the
square, and that my playing three
times the worth against a bauble of a
watch was an evident proof of it, since
I might lose even with pack’d cards,
that I very well knew the gentleman
who came in, who owed me a grudge
for the same reason, my winning his
money; that though losers have a
right to speak, they have no right to
defame, that it was a common thing
for those who lose by gaming to
think with prejudice to the winner;
that a gambler was not my known
character; that it was dangerous to
attack a man’s reputation without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
good proof, and that his proof would
never stand good before an equitable
magistrate, for that it was impossible
for that person, or any other to prove
that I had pack’d the cards, that time
or any other; that a blow from a
strange man, nay from any man,
was an unaccountable outrage, and
that though I was reduced by a train
of misfortunes, to such a pitch as to
apply for service, yet that I was far
from deserving such ill usage, in the
attack on my person, on the one
hand, and on my reputation on the
other. He heard all this with patience
and only replyed, damn him,
let him begone, I shall get nothing
by suing a beggar; I was glad to take
his advice, so taking my leave of my
own friend I left the place, and you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
may be assured, fellow-prisoners,
with abundance of alacrity,—for I
thought of one thing and he of another,—I
thought of the gallows,
which I knew I deserved, though
not from him, and he only thought
of a bite. This affair made me more
cautious of getting myself recommended
to any man, but what could
I do without money, all I had to do
was to apply to my reputed father,
which I did on the instant, not
without apprehension of being known
by some of his customers, who frequented
the house, I went at night,
and was received like the prodigal
son, with this difference, that I neither
wanted the best robe, a ring
on my finger, or the fatted calf,—my
exigence was of quite another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
nature; I wanted the <i>universal pass</i>,
and I did not well know how to ask
it; however I told him of my resolution
to travel, if I had his permission,
which if I gained, I knew
the needful would not be wanting.
I was happy enough to prevail, he
complied, and after a fond parting
and a great deal of good advice he
gave me twenty guineas, little knowing
that I had been used to larger
sums. He then went with me himself
to his wine merchant, who dealt
largely at the Mediterranean, for
which place a ship lay ready. I
thought I should never get safe out
of the kingdom, but setting sail
we soon arrived at Leghorn. I had
letters of credit, for small sums to
be given me by gales as I called for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
them, and taking a lodging at a Cabaretto,
and some refreshment, I
went to bed, where I slept serenely,
as I slept secure from all the terrors
which had long banished the sweet
and healing deity from my eyes.</p>

<br>
<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>Conclusion of the life of</i> Tom Traveller.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">After a sweet and most profound
repose, such as I have
not experienced from the time I had
left my father’s house first, I awoke,
and knowing that nature after a
great sea sickness, for I was sick the
whole voyage, found an inclination
to an egg or two, so went down and
ordered the landlord to get me some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
for breakfast, who told me that he
had none but turkey eggs, and those
he was sure I would not eat; I asked
him why? for I should like them
to choose, if they were new-laid; he
said they were laid that morning,
but that it was monstrous to eat
them in Leghorn, as they were devoted
to another use.—What to be
set, and hatched said I—ay to be
sure, he replied, staring at me, as
if I was a fool or a madman, why,
continued he, they are devoted to
our clergy: Sir, an English sailor like
you, once called for eggs, and I had
none but turkeyeggs, as is the present
case, but he would have them, yes,
da—n his eyes, and he had them, but
Sir, as he was breaking the shell, out
popt a little young cardinal, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
red hat, who thus accosted him.—Why
you English son of a bitch,
how dare you break my house over
my head, though my mother was
but an oyster, I’d have you to know
that my father was a cardinal; he
swore heartily to the truth of it,
and finding him a facetious lyar,
laughed as heartily as he swore, but
nevertheless eat three of the cardinal’s
mothers with a great deal of
satisfaction; I then took a walk to
see the city, in high-dress, and as I
was walking through one of the
streets, saw a great crowd of people
going into a tavern, whom I also
accompanied. The landlord seemed
to be a man about fifty years of
age, of a florid healthy countenance,
plump and sleek; who thus accosted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Gentlemen, I am perhaps the greatest
curiosity in Europe, how old do you
take me to be? all agreed not above
fifty, I shall, gentlemen, on the 19th
of next month, be in the hundred and
fifteenth year of my age, and never
drank any thing but water in my
life, nor ever knew any woman but
my wife, never was bled, never took
physic, never knew one sick minute,
I thank Providence; now gentlemen
follow me, and I’ll shew you a greater
prodigy than myself. We followed,
and the first thing that presented itself
to our sight, was a cradle, in
which lay an old man, who seemed
to have lived in the days of good
queen Bess, so wrinkled, so emaciated
was his face; his beard extended
to his navel, his eyes sunk in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
head, and I could compare the skin
to nothing but shrivell’d parchment,
well, said the landlord, in that cradle
lies my youngest son, he is not 72
till the 14th of March, hardships in
war, and travel by sea and land, together
with a most dissolute life
spent with women, and in drunkenness,
have brought him to this untimely
old age; he has been a fool
these twenty years, which saved his
life to this time, because it disabled
him from pursuing his former courses,
a sad example of immorality and
lewdness, as I am a standing monument
of the contrary. Thus gentlemen,
you have seen two of the
greatest curiosities in Leghorn, if
not in Europe, for a dollar a piece,
and you are all extraordinary welcome.—When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
the company went
away, I asked my landlord if he
could provide me an interpreter to
shew me the other curiosities of that
famous city; which request he soon
complied with, and I went with
him; I told him my desire of seeing
some of the courtezans, and he
took me to a public stew; the custom
and manner of which being extremely
curious, I shall describe to you in
as concise a manner as I can. My
guide and interpreter knocked at the
gate of one of the highest in repute.
A porter appeared, to whom he gave
two pence in our money. He rung
a bell, and this produced an appearance
of a priest, who in Italian,
which my guide interpreted, remonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
against our entrance, but
this was only form, inveighing solemnly
against the heinousness of our
intentional sin; the guide paid him his
fee for his kind admonition, which
was six pence, he also rung a bell, and
the doctor appeared, who brought us
into his room, and examined us as
to our health, but would take nothing
but occular proof by convincing
his own eyes. When this scrutiny
was over, he received the same
fee with the parson; in his turn he
called the madona, or mother-abbess
by ringing a bell, who on the instant
appeared, and introduced, into
what I may call the painted gallery,
which presented us with the pictures
of the most celebrated courtezans in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Italy, particularly those of Leghorn,
both of those who were dead, and
of those who were living.—I asked
by my interpreter, if the famous
beauty Domitella was living, and
was answered in the affirmative, and
at present in Naples, in keeping by
cardinal <i>Putezzi</i>, the Queen’s confessor,
and archbishop of <i>Naples</i>. I
asked next for the pictures of those
women who resided in this particular
<i lang="it">Licentiadi</i>, and was led into two
rooms, the one the sick-room, the
other that of health, wherein the
pictures were disposed, and changed
from room to room, as they fell
down, or recovered. She desired me
to take my choice, and pointing with
my stick to one of the most beautiful
in my fancy, was told, she was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
night to dance with a young jesuit
in disguise, for she is marked
with white lead, you see two or
three more are taken out already,
and who therefore are at the baths
preparing to receive their respective
lovers.—I asked how many beauties
there might possibly be, and was
told, that she had then in the college,
seventy-four in health, and
about ninety ill: I was determined
now I was in, to go through with
the ceremonies of this temple of
Venus, and having singled out another,
a bell rung which brought the
original to my sight; she happened
to be a beautiful little woman, of
uncommon vivacity, we dined together,
and in the evening, she left
me to go to the baths, while my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
guide and I took a walk mong the
parterres and gardens of this common
seraglio; we could observe many
females of exquisite beauty peeping
through the lattices, and some of
them wantonly nodded at us, and
many were in their smocks. At four
the great bell rung to invite us to
prayers; I thought this the most
daring and flagrant piece of hypocrisy
I had ever met with.—I went
to prayers, and did as I saw others
do; there were a great many elegant
women of remarkable beauty, and a
great number of men, as well Italians
as foreigners; but the young
courtezans were disposed in a seperate
place from us. After prayers,
another bell rung which invited all
to the coffee-room, and here was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
little or no distinction, some drinking
by themselves, some in couples,
and some in droves, some drank negus,
tea, coffee, capillaire, just as
they thought proper, there being
here, neither distinction, nor respect
of persons, but all were well dressed
except some English captains, and
lieutenants of the navy, who dressed
in their own manner, <i lang="fr">a la mode de
vaisseau</i>.</p>

<p>A band of musick then struck up
in the assembly-room, one of the
largest and handsomest I had ever
seen; this was adorned with a gallery
for those who did not chuse to
dance.—The windows were blinded,
and the room illuminated by a
number of globes, beside branches
of wax candles; we danced and went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
through all the ceremonies of a ball,
or rather ridotto, there being sweet-meats
and every other thing elegantly
disposed in the buffettos, and about
eleven the bell rung for supper
which ended at twelve, and then
all retired; and every gentleman-lover,
was lighted to the scene of
delight by his respective sultana. In
the morning, I arose and bid my
guide who did not dance, nor celebrate
any of the mysteries, except
taking two or three glasses of wine,
to pay the night’s expences, which
came in all to no more than a chequin,
or nine and six-pence of our
money; the cheapest entertainment
I had ever met with in my life; for
the courtezan herself receives nothing
from her lover; and yet they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
all live in the most accomplished
elegance and affluence. The madona,
or mother-abbess pays a great rent
to the Pope for her license, as do two
thousand other houses in this city.
What then must all the licensed
brothels in Italy pay? this income,
thus produced, it is pretended, goes
to maintain certain vessels of war to
fight against the Turks, but I believe
this immense sum centers in the
coffers of his holiness, which minds
of a tribute arising, formerly in ancient
Rome, from the temples of
<i>Cloacina</i>, imposed by one of the emperors,
and which one of his ministers
told him stunk in the noses of
the people of Rome; the emperor
shewed him a great heap of gold,
and asked him if that stunk.—no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
says the minister; why then says the
emperor, why should the tap stink
which produces so flagrant, so sweet
a smell? We left the temple of Venus,
and having discharged my guide,
and seen every thing worth attention
in Leghorn, took ship to visit the
<i>Archipelago</i>, where are dispersed a
great number of islands, small and
great. Having set to sea, we were
overtaken by a storm, and were
drove on shore on an island of which
the captain said he knew nothing
more than that it must certainly be
one of the Arches. This made us
cautious of going up into the land,
without being armed.</p>

not to be</ins> found in our Maps.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">Therefore forty of us (among
which I was one) declared
our inclination of reconnoit’ring this
island: It was rocky, sandy, and
therefore desart, which we supposed
to be the reason of it’s being never
noticed by seamen; for as the
Arches are a kind of a serpentine
walk on the sea, a Dedalean labyrinth,
it is more than possible, it is
morally probable, that one thousand
mariners in one thousand years,
might never be obliged by storm,
course, chance, or accident to have
entered into the narrow ferry, or ferries,
dividing it from forty others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
insignificant as itself, which surround
it. So that we were not surprized that
after searching all the maps, charts,
gazetteers, and even the great geographical
dictionary for this island,
we found all our attempts to find it
entirely fruitless and abortive; on
the hazard of reconnoit’ring the island,
which was not seemingly more than
two leagues in length and one in
breadth, we took four rounds of
cartridge, that in case of an attack,
we might be able to facilitate our
retreat to the boats; we went up
about half a mile into the country,
when we could plainly espy without
glasses, a great number of the inhabitants
on a hill who seemed flocking
together to observe our motions,
not without seeming apprehension of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
an invasion, which notwithstand from
their numbers compared to ours, they
must have laughed at; however, we
made friendly signals of distress to
invite them down, which they seemed,
either not to understand, or to
disregard; we then took courage,
thinking that they could be no more
than a parcel of peasants, or at best
a raw militia, so we proceeded to
the foot of the hill, but on our advancing
so far, and looking forward,
instead of having the least retrospect
towards the ground we had passed,
our small corps was quite surrounded,
and made prisoners of war. They
took from us our arms, without entering
into any discourse with us, and
taking the barrels out of the stocks
with more dexterity than a gun-smith,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
they planted them on a rising
ground, and returning us the empty
stocks, pointed to the artillery they
had just planted, with the greatest
solemnity and presence of mind,
and then making signs that we should
depart, dismissed us, still pointing to
our gun-barrels, significantly expressing
by their silence, (for they
said not a word) that our own arms
should be pointed against us, if we
dared come there again; we were
very well satisfied with this discharge,
since as there appeared several thousand
of them against us poor forty,
we prudently did not discharge one
piece at them, which might have
irritated them to such a degree, as
to cut us to pieces; so we made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
fine expedition of it, and returned
in safety to our boats, which conveyed
us on board, where when we
appeared with our empty stocks
without barrels, we were heartily
laughed at by our ship-mates.</p>

<p>Here <i>Hugh of the Borough</i> interrupted
<i>Tom Traveller</i>, by asking him,
what manner of people the natives
of the island were, seeing they were
so grave, reserved, and silent, to
which <i>Tom</i> replied, will you believe
me, <i>Hugh</i>, every mother soul of
them <i>Monkeys</i>.—<i>Monkeys</i>, I assure
you upon the word of a traveller,
and ever since from our journal of
observations, we have marked down
the place, and given it the name of
<i>Monkey-Island</i>, and it is well known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
in a true and correct map, since engraved
and published.—Now as
we cannot attest the truth of this
last part of <i>Tom Traveller</i>’s relation,
concerning either the discovery of
this new island, or the circumstantial
particulars of their being disarmed,
yet this we are sure of, that
there are several miraculous events,
and as equally unknown islands set
down in the maps, charts, journals,
voyages, and travels of very grave
and credible writers both ancient and
modern, whom, nevertheless we do
not pretend to discredit, nor do presume
to dis-authenticate, since they,
bear an equal shew of probability
with the relation of <i>Tom Traveller</i>,
who by his name has a right to stretch
as well as those worthy voyagers or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
map-makers. Here ended his narrative,
however, and upon that sole

<p class="drop-capy">We would not be understood to
reflect any oblique hints,
innuendos, or insinuations on our
own affairs, by this landing of a
single ship’s company on an enemy’s
coast, and we desire the politicians
to forbear construing the affair of the

of the ministry. Far be

so great a disparity between the two
incidents, that we hope to be acquitted
of this charge, by every wise
politician, as it is remote from our
purpose to make any such odious
comparisons.</p>

<p>We shall resume our respectable
history, verily believing, and nearly
assured, that when it is read and
thoroughly examined by the reviewers,
whether monthly, or critical,
it will appear, for truth, candor,
wit, humour, learning, ingenuity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and invention to exceed, either
the ancient history of <i>Reynard</i> the
Fox, or the modern one of <i>Pompey</i>
the little.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> the <i>Cat</i>, being rejoiced at his
releasement, exerted himself that
night in the greatest inactivity, according
to the philosophic dream of
<i lang="la">bis inertiæ</i>. For he slept heartily
and had several pleasant dreams,
which <i>Artemidorus</i> never dreamed of,
as we do not find one of them in his
collection of dreams. His fellow
servant lately discharged, had ever
since her quarrel fell enamoured of
<i>Tom</i>’s beauty, and consequently resolved
to wheedle him away the first
opportunity she could lay hold of.
<i>Tom</i>, she knew would follow her all
over the world, and she thought it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
was a thousand pities, so fine a fellow
as <i>Tom</i> should spend his days
with so despicable a wretch as her
late mistress, to which species of
women, I think they give the common
name of a <i>Brimstone</i>, and others
tack that of a dog’s wife to it.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> was now a quarter old, being
born on the 21st of <i>December</i> 1751,
whence some think he was called
<i>Tom</i>: However, as his mistress <i>Clotilda</i>
was a Methodist, we can give
no credit to this surmise. Though
he was but three months of age,
yet was he gigantic in his stature,
being at this age as large, as some
old full-grown Cats. His make was
of the athletic; his shoulders were
brawny, and his hinder parts resembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
those of the tyger, but in
nothing more did his beauty consist,
than in the exteriour, which strikes
first, and which saved him from being
drowned; for he was beautifully
variegated in colour like the leopard,
neither two much streaked, nor too
much spotted, but finely intermingled
on a milk-white ground,
the streaks and spots justly proportioned
in the most admirable symmetry:
His belly and breast were immaculate
as the swans, which greatly
heightened the characteristic beauty
of his face, which looked like that
of a fine woman, when she adds half
a dozen small patches, disposed with
art in such a manner, as to impart
an additional strength to each charm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
His eyes, which were of the sapphire,
had an unspeakable tenderness, mixed
with a masculine significancy, and
the other appurtenances of his face,
his whiskers long and short were of
an elegant projection. His constant
play-fellow, his tail was of the serpentine
spiral, sometimes he would
curl it, and then it bore a near resemblance
to the streamer of a man
of war when the breezes curl it, at
the top-mast head. It was <i>tipt</i> with
<i>silver</i>, like a <i>verger</i>, when he introduces
one into a pew of the Cathedral.
His mien and carriage were
stately, august, and solemn, except
when he ran, and then neither the
<i>Hind</i> nor the <i>Panther</i> could vie with
him in fleetness.</p>

<p>Thus formed, thus arrayed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
robes of ermin, who could have eyes,
and not confess the superiour beauties
of <i>Tom</i>, in comparison of which all
other <i>Cats</i> seemed <i>Rats</i>, either in
size or excellence. In genius he was
a <i>Mouser</i>, but many and great were
his acquired abilities. The boys,
who loved him from a kitten, had
taught him to play at leap-frog, but he
soon exceeded his young masters by
leaping over half a dozen of them
standing. They used him to leap over
a horizontal stick as high as they could
hold it up. They had taught him
to pick pockets with his mouth, as
well as his paw, by putting a bit of
meat or cheese therein, and he was
able at length to cap a man of six feet
high, by jumping at his hat, and
pulling it off with admirable dexterity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
It would be tedious to enumerate
all his parts, natural and acquired,
be it sufficient to say, that
he was possessed of all those eminent
good qualities, which distinguish the
monkey.—One evening, his fellow-servant
seized a favourable opportunity,
and calling to him, <i>Tom, Tom</i>,
she turned the corner to be out of
sight; he followed the well-known
voice, and leapt into her arms; she
covered him with her apron, and
during the eclipse, he was agreeably
entertained with a slice of very fine
<i>Glou’ster</i>. When she brought him
home, she performed the ceremonies
of <i>Extreme Unction</i>, rubbing the
soles of his feet with butter. This
extreme unction differs from that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of the papists, as the <i>feline</i> is purely
<i>local</i>, and applied to those extreme
parts of the Cat, called the feet,
whereas the other is temporal, and
applied at the last moments to persons
expiring. Those wags, called
the casuists, will have it that this
temporal application at the hour of
death, is in imitation of a heathen
custom, common among the Roman
Athletæ, or wrestlers, who used to
anoint their naked bodies with oyl,
the better to <i>slip</i> out of the <i>gripe</i> of
their antagonist. But whether this
analogy will bear, we leave to those
profound theologists, who deal in
such learned disquisitions. <i>Tom</i>’s
new mistress, the better to endear
herself to his affections, poured out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
a libation of sweet milk to entertain
him the longer in lapping, that during
his perambulations across the
room, he might be induced at every
stage to visit the fountain-head,
which she liberally supplied. And
thus <i>Tom</i> became intimately acquainted
with his new appartment,
and his new mistress, both of which
he was so well satisfied with, that tho’
he had known the way, he had not
the least inclination to revisit the
place of his <i>Nativity</i>; and thus he
absolutely forgot, or neglected all
his <i>domal</i> dignities to the great disgrace
of <i>judicial Astrology</i>, wherein,
however, he very much excelled
most of his cotemporaries whether
of the feline or human species.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Here would have been a fair
opportunity for some writers,
fond of digressions, to indulge their
favourite passions, by making, or
fabricating a good long chapter upon
<i>judicial Astrology</i>, but we scorn to
swell our book to an enormous size
by any such mean expedient, as we
do not want matter, (we will not
say subject matter, for fear of offending
that delicate mythologist,
master <i>Launcelot</i>, the templar) sufficient
to carry on a larger volume,
than the present, without having recourse
to such low stratagems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>We shall give the reader a concise,
and more entertaining chapter
on the charms and morals of <i>Dolly
Tinder</i>, daughter of an eminent lamp-lighter
of this metropolis. Her mother
was as famous in her branch of
business, being a very substantial
linen-draper, (as the Welch collier
says in the recruiting officer of his
wife, poor Mary ——) it being this
matrons business to gather rags for
the paper mills. Thus born of mean
but honest parents, <i>Dolly</i>, who, as
she grew up, was a jolly bucksom
wench, seemed cut out for servitude,
and to this she applied herself with
indefatigable industry; but unhappily
for her among the other places
in which she had lived, she was in
the sixteenth year of her age, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
employ of a warfinger, in the regions
of <i>Black Fryars</i>, here it was that she
contracted an acquaintance with the
water-men, and an amour with one
of the lads of the skullers. Many
were the voyages she made on the
Thames, with her lover, who always
refused the least fee, or gratuity for
his beloved mistress, as he had reason
to expect, she would pay him the
fare in another coin. Neither did she
prove ungrateful, or unfavourable to
his wishes; for before she was in her
seventeenth year, she found her stays
grow narrower, and narrower, so as
not to be able to contain that waist,
so often commended for it’s taper
symmetry; when those evident
marks of her pregnancy appeared,
she quitted her mother’s house, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
fled for refuge to that of her mother-in-law,
who received her as the wife
of her son, and she was brought to
bed of a chopping boy, which, when
she was well, was by general consent,
carried by the good old matron
to the foundling hospital, and there
deposited; whether he is as yet received
into the marine society, we
cannot be assured, but being begot
under <i>Aquarius</i>, he may probably
one day become an able commander
at sea, and be an honour to the element
from whence he sprung. The
waterman her lover, like his native
river, was like all other lovers, liable
to inconstancy, so he soon manifested
his neglect by a very cold indifference,
and once by a severe beating.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
She was not behind hand with him,
for she revenged the insult by immediately
throwing herself into the
element of <i>Fire</i>, and took up with
a glass-man. Thus she became
again connected to her own family
affinities, since her lover had a near
correspondence with the occupation
of her father,—<i>Glass</i> and <i>Fire</i>.
As she had lived so long among the
<i>Pleiades</i>, she now removed her quarters
to the hotter constellations,
and since her Aquarius with his buckets,
was unwilling any longer to
quench that flame which he had
lighted up in her bosom, she resolved
to repel <i>heat</i> by <i>heat</i>, choosing her
residence under the sultry influence
of <i>Sirius</i>, the Dog-star; by him she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
had, during the succession of ten
years, a litter of whelps, most of
which fell to the lot of the above
repository, which as the grave receives
the <i>forlorn dead</i>, is appointed
to receive the <i>forlorn living</i>. After
so long a cohabitation, and a visible
decline in her charms, from incessant
child-bearing, it is no wonder if the
Glass man, burnt up with the flames
of coals, and the flames of love, was
now burnt to a cinder, which indeed
he was in a metaphorical sense, for
he died of a decay, and left her a
widow to the wide world, and forlorn-hope.—But
<i>Dolly</i> was not so
very much fallen into the vale of
years, being now twenty-eight, but
she retained some reliques of her
former beauty, and one day as she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
walking across the Temple courts,
an old gentleman of the Middle
Temple became enamoured of her,
and giving her the keys of his chambers,
was soon admitted to her embraces,
though not to his affections,
for she was of too liberal a nature to
refuse the repeated sollicitations of
several young Templers, with whom
she lived successively, being nevertheless
constant to each of her paramours,
during her legal administration
among them. By their bounty,
she became possessed of ten pounds,
which she generously bestowed on
an eminent chimney-sweeper, being
unwilling to quit the precincts of her
favourite element the <i>fire</i>, of which
she had so much in her constitution,
that some say, she was troubled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Messalina’s failing: But with this
Vulcan she did not chuse to live long,
being tired of his sooty embraces;
she accordingly robbed him, and
fled to the Borough, where she actually,
and for the first time married
a chairman; but thinking this condition
of life too humble, she aspired
to the coach-box, and having eloped
from the Christian beast of burthen,
she lived with Automedon, and afterwards
entered into the constellation
of Auriga, by going into the
arms of a waggoner, till at length
tired with a variety of lovers, she
prudently resolved to turn oyster-woman,
and live independant of that
monster man, so far as her warm
complexion would admit her. She
soon grew weary of this occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
of life, and lived with a <i>Jew</i>, an
old clothes-man, by whose itinerations
through Monmouth-street, she
became acquainted with her late
mistress, and entered into her service
much about the æra of our <i>feline</i>
history. The other part of <i>Dolly</i>’s
history the reader has been informed
of, and therefore we shall resume
the more respectable annals of our
Hero.</p>

<span class="lsp0 fs80">Tom <i>is bound apprentice to a dancing
master. His great progress in that
genteel Science: His adventures
with the Monkeys.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy"><i>Dolly</i> his new mistress, had
lately applied to a register office,
where for a shilling paid in hand, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
small capital, it is possible to procure
the interest of four or five
pounds a year. A most wise institution,
or rather discovery of some
sagacious æconomical personage, who
might have made an immense fortune
by his invention, had not his
envious brethren pyrated him to
the great disgrace of government,
and discouragement of genius, as
well as arts and sciences: Pity it is,
that this prudent politician, had not
been at the expence of purchasing a
patent, to ensure to himself the profits
of so great a discovery.</p>

<p>One of these learned Gentlemen,
had obtained a place for <i>Dolly</i>, who
paid the other perquisites, due on
being put into possession; I think
it is a shilling in the pound, proportionable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
to the wages; so that if
the wages be five pounds, the proprietor
of this new acquisition, whether
place-man, or place-woman,
shall receive no more than nineteen
shillings of his, or her quarter’s
wages; so that if one of these place-mongers
shall procure one hundred
such places, in one quarter, (which
is but a low computation) he shall
receive the gratuity of thirty pounds
for his pains, without advancing a
farthing capital; how high must
then this reasonable profit arise,
when the wages or sallaries amount
to ten or twenty pounds a year?
and yet this lucrative employment
is of <i>modern</i> discovery, to the great
scandal of our forefathers, who as
in the discovery of other arts, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
sciences, supinely slept, and never
dreamed of such golden advantages.
<i>Dolly</i> on going to her new place, was
sorely perplexed, what to do with her
favourite <i>Tom</i>; next to money or
man’s flesh, she loved <i>Tom</i>, and as the
former seemed the more feasible exchange,
she pitched upon it as the
more eligible; among her <i>Jew</i> acquaintance,
during her residence
with the <i>circumcised</i> cast off clothes-man,
she had recollected her intimate
connections, with a young
German of the synagogue, on whom
she bestowed some singular marks of
her affection: He had for several
seasons frequented <i>Bartholomew</i> fair,
and the <i>Borough</i>, and was proprietor
of several foreign beasts, as monkies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
man-tygers, and others of the minute
kind, whom he trained up to
his own band, beneath the discipline
of the whip and bell, and taught
them a thousand feats of activity,
and cunning, by means of the very
same doctrine which <i>Richlieu</i>, the
French general, devised to conquer
the stubborn <i>English</i> at the intended
invasion, and conquest of <i>England</i>,
viz. <i>Fear</i> and <i>Hunger</i>, but which he
admirably improved into the sanguinary
tenets of downright murder in
cold blood, a tenet, worthy the
general of a <i>most Christian King</i>.</p>

<p>To this <i>German</i>, of the <i>Hebrew</i>
race, she instantly applied and sold
poor <i>Tom</i>, under the foster name of
apprenticeship to this tyrant king of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the <i>Singeric</i> order; if the <i>Scots</i> sold
their king for a groat, and <i>Judas</i>
his master for thirty silver pennys,
how more barbarous in her to sell
her favourite, and fellow-servant for
an old cast cardinal, to adorn her
for her introduction to her new
place; but so she did, and poor <i>Tom</i>’s
indentures were made over a pot of
porter, to the disgrace of humanity,
much more of female tenderness, in
this <i>black</i> deed exceeding the cruelty
of Ynkle, who sold his mistress Yarico
for an inconsiderable sum. How
could she wear this <i>black</i> robe, which
every day threw in her face the
<i>blackness</i> of her guilt and ingratitude;
if she could not recollect the many
gambols of his infancy, and the
sweeter endearments of <ins class="corr" id="tn-103" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'his m or advanced'">
his more advanced</ins><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
and adult age, if she could
forget the many songs with which he
entertained her, both at meals, at
work, and in bed, where he often
purred her to sleep; sure she ought
to think of her fellow-sufferer, and
fellow-servant with more compassion
than to deliver him into the hands
of a savage, among savages, under
whose intolerable cruelty he must
endure many and severe stripes, beside
the accumulated hardships of
confinement, and starving.—Unhappy
<i>Tom</i>! better had it been for
thee, ere thy eyes were opened, to
have shared the fate of thy brethren
and sisters, long since past the sense
and feeling of their sufferings.</p>

<p>But we will not dwell longer on
so mournful a subject, an event, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
itself, of so tragic a nature, as may
extort tears from many of our compassionate
readers.</p>

<p>The first letter of salutation <i>Tom</i>
was taught by his dancing master,
was to leap thro’ a hoop, but as he
was some months before learnt to
leap over the stick by his young
school-fellows, he easily went thro’
this exercitation to the no small surprize
of his master, who yet imputed
this first step to <i>Tom</i>’s natural genius;
and therefore promised himself
all success imaginable from so
sensible, and so active a creature.
Though <i>Tom</i> had in his younger days
often described the <i>diagonal parallelogram</i>
circle in pursuit of his own
tail, round which he had performed
as many <i>revolutions</i> in a <i>day</i>, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
<i>Earth</i> does round the <i>Sun</i> in a <i>century</i>,
yet had he never till now made
an <i>horizontal</i> line through the <i>center</i>
of a circle. He was next tried in
the begging attitude, but in this too
he excelled all the quadrupeds that
ever came within the jurisdiction of
this German posture master, so that
in his second lesson, he surprized his
master as agreeably as before, and
actually followed a piece of meat,
which was conducted before him,
by way of <i>precedent</i>, more erect than
many of his bipedal fellow-creatures
of the more dignified species; his
next instruction was to perform the
<i>gradation</i> of a perpendicular ladder of
ropes; in this he was somewhat awkward,
but by degrees, and as it were
by <i>gradation</i>, he acquitted himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
tollerably well for the first time, and
was esteemed as an excellent scholar,
and his master boasted of his
new pupil’s proficiency with more
than ordinary elevation of voice and
spirit. By de lord, dat made me,
says the <i>German</i>, dancing-master,
me hav one kot, dat vil bring me
more monis, in one, two, three
monts, dan all my monkies togeder,
me wou’d not give him for one
guinea, at dis present time, and fen
he is made to my hond, me wou’d
no give him for ten. Thus the first
day passed to the great credit, and entire
satisfaction of his master, who
threw aside the whip and bell, believing
from such a great docility
that he should never more have occasion
for it with respect to <i>Tom</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
who was notwithstanding tied up to
his respective post, with a good strong
whip-cord. But as Dalilah bound
Sampson with cords, sufficient as
she thought to bind him down to
his good behaviour, which he broke
as a man would flaxed threads, so in
vain did the German posture-master
tie up <i>Tom</i> who made a shift to knaw
the bands asunder, and give himself
liberty; but alas! the door was shut,
and he found himself to his great
mortification, as close a prisoner as
ever; so casting about to find a vent-hole
for his escape, he searched to
no purpose, and seeing a strange
groupe of unnatural figures about
him, his curiosity led him to approach
them, which he did to their
no small surprize and terror, and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
they spoke to him in an unknown
languague, so he found that conversation,
which he desired with his
fellow-prisoners, cut off; he first
came in a gentle manner, and saluted
the old baboon with a loud
mew, and was answered with a loud
chatter, which at first disconcerted
him very much, not well knowing
whether the noise he made was a signal
of friendship, or antipathy; however,
as he judged his fellow-prisoner’s
heart by his own integrity,
he proceeded, and extended his paw,
as it were to play with the old gentleman,
which the other bit almost to
the bone, and had very nigh disabled
poor <i>Tom</i> from ever practising
another lesson, this rough return to
his good-nature so irritated <i>Tom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Cat</i>, that he fell upon <i>Pug the Monkey</i>’s
leathern jaws which he tore in
a terrible manner, and then went
round with the whole neighbourhood,
not daunted even at the man-tyger’s
dreadful form, for Tom had
such intrepid courage that he would
venture upon the Devil himself in
his anger, had he been in the shape
of any of those creatures, though it
were an <i>armed rhinoceros, or the
Hyrcanian tyger</i>.</p>

<p>The out cry that was set up in
the prison, brought the keeper, who
judged that some of them had broke
loose and fallen upon the rest, but
least of all did he judge his favourite
<i>Tom</i>’s having slipt his collar, but
easily guessed how matters went,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
when he saw the old baboon, the
man-tyger, and the other lesser creatures
bleeding. He considered what
part he should take, or what measures
pursue, in so interesting an affair.
He rightly believed that <i>Tom</i>
must have been the aggressor, as it
was consistent to reason so to imagine.
He had got a great deal of money,
by his old acquaintance the singerical
fraternity, and never had handled
a penny piece of <i>Tom</i>’s gettings, but
then he might possibly get a fortune
by so extraordinary and so promissing
a genius, beside, thought he, the
poor fellow, not dreaming any harm
might have come too near them,
and so have received the first blow,
which he owned was provoking to
one of <i>Tom</i>’s spirit, but when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
saw the creature limping up to him,
and his fine coat tore in several places
he was confirmed in his opinion, that
the battle sprung from the malevolent
monkeys, whom yet he thought it
hard to chastise as they had suffered
sufficiently from the enraged fury of
our feline hero. He however took
up the whip, and bell and brandished
over the heads of the terrified society,
taking <i>Tom</i> along with him,
as one unfit for such quarrelsome
companions, and worthy of a superior
destination; he therefore took
him up to his own room, and having
clasp’d a leather collar round his neck
to which he affixed a neat brass chain,
he pinned it down to the floor, permitting
him a good scope to walk
about the room, after this he combed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
him and examining his legs, he applyed
a little butter to it, which
<i>Tom</i> by constantly licking, as it was
kept constantly greased, soon made a
cure of. When he was perfectly recovered
the German took abundance
of pains in his education, teaching
him to walk fast, to run, and to
jump on his hind feet, so that <i>Tom</i> at
the age of five months, became a perfect
adept, and could cut capers higher
than mons. —— the French dancer.
He in three days made him tumble
head over heels, backwards and
forwards, and even three Somersets
at once. Had he possessed the hands
of tenacity like those of the monkey,
<i>Tom</i> would have excelled all of that
species, taught or untaught. This
was a great deficience in <i>Tom</i>’s make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
and form, and as sensible a grief to his
master, who would have given ten
guineas that <i>Tom</i> had pugs hands,
but as the poet says, <i lang="la">non omnia possumus
omnes, nec licet cuivis adire
corinthum</i>, and with this scrap of
Latin we shall abrutly conclude this
chapter, in order to have an opportunity
of displaying our learning, and
to begin another chapter.</p>

<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>Tom commences an amour with a young
lady of his own kidney.—He turns
actor and makes his first appearance
on the stage at Bartholomew-fair.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">Tom was according to the
custom of this celebrated place
invested with all the requisite apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of <i>Yates</i> and <i>Shuter</i>. The
day was proclaimed by the Lord-Mayor,
and the usual solemnities,
performed, of which <i>Tom</i> was entirely
ignorant. To describe this great
festival would be superfluous to most,
therefore, for the sake of the few,
we shall confine ourselves to the department
of <i>Tom</i> the <i>Cat</i>. The bill
run thus, several pantomime entertainments
by a real <i>Cat</i>, who excels
<i>Maddox</i> on the wire, plays the slight
of hand better than —— performs
the dexterity of rope-dancing, and
tells fortunes; little, very little of
this, oh! ingenious reader did <i>Tom</i>
the <i>Cat</i>, know any thing of it; yet
his wise promulgators, thought proper
to impose on his supposed wisdom,
and on the ignorance of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
who had met there to be imposed
upon.</p>

<p>The German had however employed
a piece of canvass to represent
the figure of <i>Tom</i>, in his various
attitudes, something like those
exhibited of <i>Steward</i>, <i>Saunders</i>, <i>Maddox</i>,
and Miss <i>Wilkinson</i>; attitudes
which the <i>Cat</i> never performed.</p>

<p>The populace were drawn in, and
more came to see <i>Tom</i> the <i>Cat</i>’s performance
than that of either <i>Shuter</i>
or <i>Yates</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>Tom</i> the <i>Cat</i>, made his
first appearance at Bartholomew-fair,
it was not doubted but he would give
the greatest satisfaction. The monkeys
and their tribe were first introduced
to the people, who played
their old tricks over and over; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
when the people called aloud for
<i>Tom</i>’s appearance it was then, and
not till then, that the sport of the
fair begun; they gaped wide, when
there appeared several gentlemen of
the human species; two by two,
then several ladies of the female
species, two by two, dressed in robes
of mimic tissue; maids of honour
in pairs, with white gloves. Next
baboon, king at arms, dressed in his
regalia, attended by two ushers;
next came the ladies of the bed-chamber,
followed by two pages of
the back-stairs, two train bearers;
who bore the princesses coronet on a
velvet cushion, adorned with the
arms of the <i>singeric</i> order; and in
the middle, supported by two <i>feline</i>
lords, appeared <i>Tom</i> beneath a canopy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of state. He was known, as
<i>Garrick</i> is, or as <i>Barry</i> and <i>Mossop</i>
was, by the dignity of his steps,
and by other marks and badges of
his superiority over all the rest.
For oh! reader; believe me, who
was present at this triumphal procession,
that this mock entrance was
no more than the artifice of a German,
purely invented to deceive you,
and to draw you in, whereas, there
was nothing worthy to be seen, but
the figure and appearance of <i>Tom</i>,
graced or rather disgraced by the attendance
of these <i>syngeric</i> animals.</p>

<p>When he appeared first there was
an universal clap of applause, tho’
he neither said or did any thing;
he had been taught to make his
usual obedience in private, as players<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
study their parts and get one to hold
them, to see if they are <i>gotten perfect</i>.</p>

<p>The first part he appeared in was
in the <i>jack-scene</i>, which as it was
drawing up, he times the motion,
leaping upon it, goes it ever so swiftly,
on which he stands till the leads are
drawn up. Then, like <i>Harlequin</i>,
he is seen in the wheel turning a
heavy spit, laden with several joints
of flesh and fowl, cut out in wood,
at length he leaps out of the wheel,
and is received by the cook in the
frying pan, out of which he jumps
into the fire, to verify the good old
proverb, <i>out of the frying pan into
the fire</i>. This fire being painted to
deceive, did accordingly deceive the
ignorant, but as <i>Tom</i>’s feet never felt
the heat of it, so did he after many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
grimaces of the feet (allow me the
expression) jump directly on the
ladder of ropes placed in a vertical
position, on which he descended and
ascended better than e’er a minister
of them all. The monkeys were
put to the trial, but they could not
execute like him; in his begging attitude,
he collected for his master
forty pence, out of a hundred and
fifty present; but when he jumped
through the hoop on the stage, they
all threw down half-pence, pence,
and shillings, which he had too
much honour to gather up, but left
that to his substitute, the German’s
wife.</p>

<p>A female cat was then introduced,
with whom he was to dance a minuet:
This too he performed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
satisfaction of all present; and when
the stewards appointed him to lead
up the country dances, no person
there was more alert or brisk, than
he to see that the ladies were properly
served with negus, tea, or coffee,
as they desired: After this it is
said, there was an <i>Harlequin</i> entertainment
performed, in which <i>Tom</i>
played the part of <i>Harlequin</i>, and
his mistress or partner that of <i>Columbine</i>,
to the utmost satisfaction of
all the people who visited the German’s
booth on this occasion, and
some go so far as to say that neither
<i>Shuter</i> or <i>Yates</i> had much company
that night, as the German had cunningly
inserted it at the top of his
bills that the character of the <i>Harlequin</i>,
was to be performed by <i>Tom</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the <i>Cat, who never appeared on any
stage before</i>, and the character of
<i>Columbine</i> by a young Lady of the
<i>Cat-kind, it being the first time of her
appearing in that character</i>. This
is the lady of the feline quality with
whom <i>Tom</i> from this happy occasion
of playing <i>Harlequin</i> with her commenced
an amour.</p>

<p>With this young virgin <i>Tom</i> was
locked up by the German, in order
to have a fine breed by them. She
was of a pure milk white, unspotted
as her chastity, had been the favourite
puss of a lady not so unspotted as
herself; her ladyship seldom went a
visiting without her dear <i>Araminta</i>,
(so she called her;) unhappy for
poor <i>Minty</i> she was one summer’s
evening diverting herself with catching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
flies, when this cruel son of
Judah took her up, and ran away
with her; and though her ladyship
advertised her with marks, and tokens,
and a handsome reward, yet
the Jew locked her up so close, that
there never was any tidings of her
since, till this respectable history discovered
the place of her confinement,
and sent <i>Tom</i> to be the knight
to this distressed damsel.</p>

<p>On being closetted by this superb
beauty, <i>Tom</i> fell deeply ennamoured,
as indeed what Cat could withstand
her insuperable charms without feeling
the flames of love. It is said
that his passion for her gave him a
poetical turn, and produced these
lines of the feline composition.</p>

<p>Whether he sat it to music himself,
or some other celebrated master
framed the vocal composition,
we cannot certainly say, but we hear
it was sung by a very good voice
at the fair in the presence of <i>Minty</i>’s
self, who doubtless was not a little
proud to hear her beauties extolled
by her own lover.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> was too courtly to attack her
any other way, than <i lang="fr">en Cavalier</i>—and
she was not so prudish as to cry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
<i>Pish!</i> like some modern fine ladies,
or say—I would not have you
imagine me so easy a conquest,—or
I am none of those creaters you
think me, and such stuff—as his
professions were honourable, and as
she was conscious of her own beauty,
she believed his vows to be unfeigned,
and though,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Conscious of her beauty she look’d down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Permitting the admiring sighing lover</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without restraint to feed upon her charms.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet, she was not ashamed to confess
an equal passion for him, and to
repay his love and sincerity, with
the surrender of those charms, which
none but so handsome a fellow as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
<i>Tom</i> could either conquer or deserve;
we shall here be silent, and draw a
curtain over those conubial delights,
which we cannot paint: Certain it
is, that they were both virgins, and
therefore some people may be apt,
superstitiously to apprehend that the
first child must be a fool; but to
falsify that vulgar opinion, we can
affirm, that the first child <i>Minty</i> ever
had, was the wittiest of the five, of
which she was delivered this lying
in, and that the last born died of a
miserable consumption, contracted
in the womb from the imbecility of
its texture. However, she was not
so delicate or tender as to keep her
room for the fashionable month:
History affirms, that she killed two
lusty mice, eat a slice of bacon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
which she lighted on by accident,
and went through the part of Columbine
two days after delivery.
The applause <i>Tom</i> got in the character
of Harlequin procured him
such a character as the celebrated
<i>Lun</i> himself never purchased, with
all his feats of activity; nay,
this approbation went so far, that
several people came to converse and
familiarly play with him and actually
gave him money, which he put into
his master’s hands to keep for him;
notwithstanding his confinement
grew very irksome to <i>Tom</i> and his
young lady, yet he fared very elegantly.
He had bread and milk,
for his breakfast every day, fresh
meat for his dinner, and milk for
supper; she indeed during her pregnancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
longed for tea, of which the
Jew seldom drank any.</p>

<p>To obtain freedom for himself
and dear <i>Minty</i>, became now the sole
object of his attention; it engrossed
all his thoughts, and almost interfered
with his business. No husband on
earth, could love a wife better than
he did his <i>Minty</i>, but love itself, incompatible
with bondage and confinement
seemed to give way to the
noble efforts for freedom, with
which his mind struggled. She indeed
was a sharer in his misfortunes,
which in some measure sweetned the
bitter cup, and alleviated his misery,
and though he did not understand
Latin, yet he thought with the Roman
Poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Salamæn miseris socios habuisse doloris.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">As he was taking a walk with <i>Minty</i>,
he observed a mouse under the
bed, and darting at it, he missed his
aim, but made a happy discovery.</p>

<p>Not the famous <i>Erwin</i>, when he
thought he found out the longitude
by discovering the immersion of the
satellite of <i>Jupiter</i>, could be more
sensibly affected with raptures of
delight, than our hero was on the
discovery of a mouse-hole, which
led into the next garret. Not
<i>Columbus</i>, when he found <i>America</i>,
nor <i>Cortez</i> on discovering the <i>Indian</i>
mines of gold could be more
overjoyed. He would have cried,
ευρηκαμεν, but he happened not to
understand the Greek—sure it is
he thought it, though he did not
express it in terms; but he was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
sooner about reconnoitring the place,
in order to invest it <i lang="la">vi et armis</i>, than
the door opened, and he was for
ever torn away from the arms of his
beloved <i>Minty</i>. Oh! dire misfortune
to lose his mistress, together
with the means of escape, and just
at the very crisis of the discovery.</p>

<p>So have I known a bard who
having happily nicked a line, finds
himself embarressed and sorely perplexed
to discover a rime to it. He
consults <i>Bysshe</i>’s Art of Poety, turns
over the leaves, and investigates the
whole volume to catch the rhime,
but in vain—at length he scratches
his head, pares his nails with his
teeth, and fathoms the depth of his
own memory, when, oh! unspeakable!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
a dun raps at the door, the
rhime, just in the point of view,
escapes him, and is lost for ever,
never alass to be again recovered.
It had been some consolation thought
<i>Tom</i>, with himself, if this interruption
was deferred only till I had made
the discovery to my charming <i>Minty</i>—now
she must pine in solitude,
and waste the remainder of her
widowhood in fruitless anguish and
imprisonment; constrained to obey,
though reluctant, every summons of
her lordly ruler, to frisk, and dance
without inclination, for the entertainment
of a pitiful mob. Thus he
lamented, till he was brought down
stairs to be exhibited as a shew; for
his extroardinary beauty and the rumour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of his many excellent qualifications
had drawn several to drink
at the house where the Jew lodged,
in order to have a sight of <i>Tom the
Harlequin</i>, as he was now nick-named
though other historians, and
some commentators differ in this
point, insisting that he was more
universally called <i>Harlequin Tom</i>. Our
penetration is not sufficiently piercing
to discuss this, or to determine the
dispute either in the affirmative or
the negative. Many, however, were
the encomiums bestowed on the singularity
of his shape, his fine skin,
and extraordinary stature, the brightness
of his eyes, the symmetry of
his limbs, the poignancy of his wit,
or the agility of his body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>When our hero had gone through
his several exercitations, the Jew
pinned down his chain to the floor,
and sat himself down with the company
who had invited him to regale
over a pot of beer, which when he
consented one of the company who
did not come there for nothing, entered
into the following dissertation,
which the reader will find in
the next chapter, and if he chuses
to read it through, he will find it
none of the most frivolous in the
history.</p>

<span class="lsp0 fs80"><i>A learned dispute concerning the mythology
of the word Cat, between
two celebrated dictionary writers,
and other of the literate compilers
of words.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-capy">From the attempt to build,
came the destruction of that
stupendous pile, or rather quarry of
stones, called <i>Babel</i>; hence some
linguists say the English word <i>babble</i>
from that destruction came the confusion
of languages, which our modern
dictionary-writers, under the
pretence of <i>distributing</i>, have thrown
all into <i>pye</i>, and are now building,
or rather rebuilding that mighty
fabric of tongues, by piling and compiling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
every new year, dictionary after
dictionary, folio after folio, so
that after a successive generation of
the alphabet, every letter of which
begets a column if not a whole page,
we may expect soon to see a babel
built of dictionaries, whose top shall
aspire unto the clouds, and once more
provoke the almighty thunderer, to
send down a vindictive bolt which
shall once more throw all tongues
into their original confusion. There
were at the same time of our hero’s
being brought down from his dearest
<i>Minty</i> about half a dozen of these
<i>Word-wrights</i>, who after having seen
the diverting drolls of <i>Shuter</i> and
<i>Yates</i>, and among other things the
performance of <i>Tom the Harlequin</i>, or
<i>Harlequin Tom</i>, (<span lang="la">utrum horum mavis accipe</span>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
were willing to pay a second
visit to our hero, and therefore
desired his master, the Jew, to bring
him into their presence, that they
might once more feast their eyes on
a creature, which they affirmed to
exceed the leopard in beauty, the
tyger in saline qualities, and the antilope
shape. This led them into a
discourse on the qualities of this creature,
and a very learned gentleman,
who understood hellenisms started a
question or quære—<i lang="la">Unde derivature
Cat?</i> For, says he with a calendered
face, we should first <i>define</i>
any word before we can arrive at its
constituent parts. The word <i>Cat</i> is
a <i>monasylable</i>, made up of the constituent
letters C. A. T. so is the
word <i>Hat</i> derived (as Tom Brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
says) quasi, from the word <i>Hate</i>, because,
says that learned antiquarian,
men <i>hate</i> to go without their <i>hats</i>,
especially quakers, and ladies who
wear them, and appear covered in
their respect places of worship. Now,
let us see, if we can’t find some word
analogous in some of the languages,
which may bear a similar analogy or
corresponding affinity to the word
<i>Cat</i>.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, in all the languages
modern, or ancient, foreign
or native, oriental, or occidental,
cannot I find <ins class="corr" id="tn-138" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'a rearer relation'">
a nearer relation</ins> to the
word <i>Cat</i>, than in the Greek language
of which you know I am a
perfect master—thus I say <i>Cat</i>, is
derived from the Greek κατα, which
being a Greek præposition, has several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
significations—analize the
word <i>Cat</i> forward, it reads <i>Cat</i>,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-139" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and and backwards'">
and backwards</ins> <i>tac</i>, and any other
way, <i>act</i>, turn it as you will now,
Sir, take the particle, or expletive
article, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>Cat</i>; turn this and
wind it as you will, it must make
either, a Cat, or atac, and borrowing
an <i>N</i>, by way of subsidiary or
ally to support the expletive <i>a</i>, he
will then be <i>an</i>, and then it will be
an atac, or an <i>attack</i>. Try the greek
word κατα—wind him, and turn him,
he makes the word, <i>atak</i>, or in our
idiom <i>attack</i>, so that our English
word, a Cat, and the greek word
κατα, signifies, either way <i>atak</i>, or
<i>atac</i>. And what creature is more
fierce to attack than a Cat, and this
I affirm to be the answer to unde<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
drivatum, a Cat, not to mention the
precise or indefinite <ins class="corr" id="tn-140" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'significations of of'">
significations of</ins> the præpositive expletive κατα.
He said, and sate down—next
spoke and stood, one split hair, a
mighty causuist in words, who perfectly
understood how to add, subtract,
divide, and multiply in words
as accomptants do in figures. He
could make fractions, and was able
to conjure down the best letter in the
alphabet into a cyper, so as to serve
him in cases of necessity, either on
the right, or the left of an other
letter; by the addition of these substitutes,
he could make any word
stand for, or mean, any thing, as the
arithmetician does, with his nine
figures, and his beloved, O, he could
make them dance country dances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>

<p>He insists that the word <i>Cat</i> was
derived from <i>Cate</i>, a delicate sweet-meat,
for why? Cats love <i>Cates</i>, and
are especially fond of licking cream?
hence, the proverb—will a <i>Cat
lick cream</i>? And, why not, interrupted
another <i>word-wright</i>, named
<i>Quasimodo</i>, why not, <i>Cat</i>, from <i>Catherine</i>,
or from <i>Catterpillar</i>? This unexpected
derivation drew over a great
many partizans, of several who were
in the seats, and some affirmed, it
was the best derivation given as
yet—Yes, says <i>Split-hair</i>, if he
supports the alphabetical authority.
A just objection, replied <i>Quasimodo</i>,
but I only take the initial part of the
word <i>Cat-her-ine</i>—or if you will
<i>Cat-he-ine</i>; I have nothing to do
with <i>he-rine</i>, or if you will <i>herring</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
because to mix it in this place with
Cat, would be confounding fish and
flesh, and producing an amphibious
meaning,—but suppose, Whittington’s
Cat, or Montaigne’s <i>Cat</i> was
called <i>Kate</i>, from Wittington’s wife
<i>Kate</i>, or <i>Cate</i>, wont that do? And as
for the word <i>Caterpiller</i>, or <i>Catercousin</i>,
or <i>Caterer</i>, or <i>Cat-call</i>, or
Cat and nine-tails, or <i>Cat</i> in pan—or
<i>Catamite</i>, each and every of these
words may be tortured to confess as
good a derivation, as your κατα, or
attack—and what do you think
(says a wag in an adjacent seat) of
the word Cat-eg-or-i-cal—much
the same says <i>Quasimodo</i>, or the
Greek appellative—<i>Hecate</i>, who
was a witch, (most Cats are said to
be witches, you know) which if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
divide, will make out the word—<i>He-cat</i>—(e
final left out) or hekaton,
a hundred—or <i>Cat-as—Strophe</i>—so
that at the <i>fag</i> end of
the business instead of a Cat a nine-tails,
you may have, a <i>Cat-hekaton</i> or
<i>Cat-a-hundred-tails</i>.</p>

<p>While this learned dissertation passed,
the German, who expected every
moment, that the Hebrew language,
would be at length brought on the
tapis, eagerly swallowed ev’ry word,
without digesting a letter, and having
drunk plentifully of the circulating
pots, which he emptied, as fast
as they came round, he had forgot
poor Tom, who by this time was
some miles off; this being the whole
design of this cabal; the intent, purpose,
end, and meaning whereof,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
was no more than to gule the poor
Jew, and steal Tom, by engrossing the
German’s attention with porter and
chat, till a proper opportunity should
be found to loose his chain, and bear
him off triumphant; which the fellow
employ’d, executed with the most
admirable dexterity, and tho’ poor
Mr. <i>Shuter</i>, was accused of being
concerned in this confederacy, our
history entitles us to acquaint him,
and <i>Yates</i>, together with all the
other droll men, and wild beast men
in the fair, and we do aver, they
were ev’ry mother’s soul of them
out of the plot, neither were any
persons, directly, or indirectly in the

history to make national reflections,
but if these annals should happen to
light into the hands of any of the
three nations, let such remember,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
that it is absurd, and ridiculous to
the last degree, to claim that respect
which the world will give them on
an imaginary title, either an estate
on the mountain of Penmanmure,
or a family descent, which, if it
ever existed, is long since extinct,
and dead to all intents and purposes.</p>

<p>But the Jews of all others run
into the greatest extravagancies in
this hypothetical system. Each and
every of them, from the meanest
pedlar up to S—— G—— will tell
you the very identical spot in the
land of Canaan, which was alloted
to them by their legislator, long before
the days of David: Nay, some
of them shall boast of such and such
of their female relations, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
the honour to be of the seraglio of
king Solomon; nor can I neglect
this favourable opportunity which
offers itself of relating a secret memoir,
of two or three of their richest
people, which may serve as a specimen
of their disinterested loyalty to
the present prince, under whose auspicious
government they enjoy all
the reasonable privileges of natural
subjects.</p>

<p>There was a traitor condemned to
be executed at Tyburn, for having
in this city watched our armaments
by sea and land, and sent timely
notice to the French king of all our
intended expeditions. When he
found that there was no hopes left,
he privately sent to a proper person,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
to acquaint him, that he had something
of moment to impart, which
regarded the welfare of the nation.
He was admitted, heard, and examined,
and actually gave information
of the particular people concerned
in the French loan, at the head of
which were the chief people of the
Jews, and principally three of their
richest and most opulent traders.
The traytor by this discovery saved his
life, at the time that the people at
Tyburn had paid for their places
to see the execution of so notorious
a malefactor. The person to whom
the information was delivered, turned
the discovery to the prudent ends
of government. He sent for the
three principal money-lenders, who
being confronted by the informer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
were obliged to confess their treachery,
and thus the loan intended for the
French king, immediately changed
its channel, and by the dexterity of
the minister, became subservient to
the expences of a tedious war.</p>

<p>Yet these loyal subjects are the
very people, to whom we were on
the point of linking ourselves, by a
voluntary act of naturalization, as if
we had entertained a presumptuous
design of frustrating all prophecies,
and making null the predictions of
their dispersion, and of these people
being a scattered people over the
face of the whole earth. It was in
vain for the son of <i>Ishmael</i> to lament
the loss of his favourite Cat. <i>Tom</i>
was irretrievably lost. His search
was fruitless, and the more he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
stirred in the search, the more he
became the object of ridicule.</p>

<p>Our hero was no sooner brought
to his new lodings, than he found
himself in the arms of his old fellow-servant
<i>Dolly Tinder</i>, by whose subtilty
the whole scheme was laid and
executed by her agents, <i>Split-Hair</i>,
and <i>Quasimodo</i>; the favorable representations
she had made to the
mistress with whom she now lived,
of the beauty and excellence of our
hero, captivated the lady with the
strongest desire to have him in her
own possession. She had indicated
this desire to <i>Split-Hair</i>, and <i>Quasimodo</i>,
two schoolmasters who attended
her son, the one in Latin, the
other in writing and accounts. She
gave them a guinea to carry on this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
design with more facility, and to
bribe proper instruments to bring
off our hero; which was accordingly
performed in the manner related.</p>

<p>Had <i>Dolly Tinder</i> given her mistress
the most valuable present, she could
not more have ingraciated herself
than by this new acquisition; she
fed him, caressed him, and did
every thing endearing to cultivate a
good acquaintance with her favourite.
He even rivalled her darling
parot in her affection; and ’tis said
Poll took umbrage at this unnatural
desertion, and did not speak a
word to his mistress for two days.
He refused even to be fed by her,
and fell into the deepest melancholy.
However, in some few days more,
<i>Tom</i> behaved with that deference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
and respect to the parrot, whose
plumage he greatly admired, and
whose interests he was somewhat
afraid of, that they entered into a
very great friendship, and correspondence
soon after, and he permitted
Poll to take some of his best
morsels, nay, brought it to his very
cage, so that in a short time after,
<i>Poll</i> would walk all over him as he
lay stretched by the fire side, and
suffered himself to be carried on his
back as Tom walked along the parlour.
But it happened one evening
in the dusk, that he espied a beautiful
young female, who seemed by
her careless air to be disposed for a
night’s ramble. Our hero, therefore,
with his usual complaisance, went up
to her, and made his inclinations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
known, that he should be glad to
share that night’s adventure in company
with so fair a creature, and she
giving a half unwilling consent, he
followed her to a dark ally; and was
never more seen or heard of by his
disconsolate mistress.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Our hero soon entered into
such close and intimate connections
with this young courtezan,
that he forgot the duties he owed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
to himself. He forgot his honour;
and all other grateful sentiments,
were erased from his heroic breast,
in this following the example of
many illustrious kings and personages
of antiquity, particularly <i>Hannibal</i>,
and <i>Alexander</i>, the one delaid by
pleasures, at Cannæ when he might
have made himself master of Rome;
the other immersed in voluptuousness,
and foreign luxury at Persepolis,
and forgetting his interests in
Macedonia.</p>

<p>Thus, in like manner, did our
<i>Tom</i> forget the duties he owed to
his new and indulgent mistress, the
lady of <i>Dolly Tinder</i>, not to mention
his obligations to that faithful fellow-servant
of his, to whom he
owed his liberty. He now ranged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
at will, and took an unlimited freedom
in the walks of love; till at
length he found himself abandoned
to sensuality, and resigned himself to
the torrent of self-indulgence which
bore him away from all morality
and virtue. He left the city, and
like a highway-man took the road
to licentuousness, committing several
robberies, and depredations,
whereever he could light on prey. He
would venture into the kitchens of
country gentlemen and rob the larder,—he
took bones of meat from
several cats, depriving them of their
meals, and like a fox, did once assault
the poultry, carrying off a young
goslin in triumph before the eyes of
a whole family of geese and ganders.
In short, his actions became infamous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
and his reputation stunk
worse than a <i>Pole-cat</i>.</p>

<p>As he was thus indulging himself
in all manner of licentiousness, wherein
the vocal songsters of the grove
were not safe from his outrages, he
went a whoring after strange <i>Cats</i>,
and having neither the fear of man,
bird, or beast before his eyes, he at
length came to a large village; his
beautiful varigated skin, fine shape,
and uncommon structure attracted
the eyes of a black Cat, the wife of
a black Cat in that village; she made
no manner of punctilio in eloping
from her sable husband, but unnaturally
left her house and home, to
enjoy the solacing embraces of this
lovely foreigner, <i>Jet</i>, for that was
her husband’s name, missing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Negro-spouse, tracked her footsteps,
and found them, <i lang="fr">tête a tête</i>, in a
neighbouring barn: Though unequal
in size or strength to our hero,
yet as the honour of his bed was
concerned, he challenged him on
the spot; a duel ensued, and after a
faint of position was laid dead at the
feet of our hero, who went farther
a field, with the wanton widow of
the deceased. But murder will out:
Several black Cats happening to be
marauding in the barn in quest of
mice, saw the body, and went in
pursuit of the murderer, whom they
also traced by the blood, with which
his claws were imbrued; they attacked
him, and seeing himself
ready to be overpowered by a superiority<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
of force, he thought the safest
expedient was to have recourse to
flight, by which he escaped their
fury. He had ran three miles, and
found himself in a field adjacent to
another village, nor was he long
there, before several Cats surrounding
him, smelt to the blood with
which his coat was deformed, which
when they found to be the blood of
their enemies, instead of tearing
<i>Tom</i> to pieces, (as they might have
done in the midst of his great fatigue)
they brought him victuals to refresh
him, and one of them conducted
him to a dairy, where he lapped milk
sufficient to recruit his lost spirits.</p>

<p>These Cats were all tabbies, and
had been long at war with the blacks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
of the neighbouring village. After
holding many conferences, and councils
of war, they <abbr><i>nem. con.</i></abbr> chose our
hero to be generalissimo in chief for
the ensuing campaign, which high
commission he most gratefully accepted;
he now became commander
in chief, and being stronger
than any other Cat in the three kingdoms,
he became conscious of his
own superiour qualifications: His
last trial of his strength, with the
sire Cat of the black nation convinced
him of his matchless abilities,
and therefore he now began to discipline
his troops, and fight mock
battles, to lay plans of operation, to
train them to skirmish, in cursions
and surprize. To teach how to
quarter on an enemy’s country, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
levy contributions, to cover the foragers,
and in short the whole process
of war, either by <i>stratagem</i>, <i lang="fr">Coup de
main</i>, or <i>Manœuvre</i>.</p>

<p>He sent out recuiting parties, who
raised a large military force in less
than a fortnight, and he lived, belov’d,
feared, and respected by the
soldiery as well as the other generals,
and officers of his new army.</p>

<p>It was on a moon-light calm
night on the glorious first of August,
the date of the year I forgot, but the
scene of action was on Black-Heath,
that <i>Tom</i> at the head of an army of
two hundred tabbies made his approaches,
which he scorned to make
in a private manner, but came up to
them openly and in the moon-light.
Neither did his motions escape their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
vigilance. He had divided his troops
into eight battalions, twenty five in
a battalion; and each battalion into
five ranks, five in a line.—Two battalions,
he left at some distance, as
a <span lang="fr">corps de reserve</span>, and with the
other six, marched up to attack
them before they could form in battle
array. However, the dispositions
of the enemy, were so well made in
front by an old experienced general,
that Tom, tho’ he made several
furious attacks to break their front,
the better to put those in confusion,
who were forming behind, found
himself mistaken both in the courage,
and discipline of his enemy. For
the wise general of the blacks, had
prudently placed a line of veterans
in the front, and as our general had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
never fought a campain before, he
found himself foil’d in his first attempt,
and thrown into some disorder;
but rallying his soldiers and
covering them like a shield, by his
own personal courage and strength,
he again formed his line of battle,
and renewed the attack:—The
enemy’s right wing seemed to have
got an advantage of our left, which
<i>Tom</i> observing dispatched an Aid du
Camp in waiting to desire the general
of the <span lang="fr">Corps de reserve</span> to advance,
but whether thro’ a misunderstanding
of the orders, or that
they were not delivered in an explicit
manner, a whole battalion of
ours was cut to pieces, while that
general, was endeavouring to explain
the orders: In the mean time, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
left wing did wonders, supporting
the attack, which was vigorous, with
uncommon ardour.—The enemies
front was repulsed several times, but
they rallied so well, and kept such
excellent order, that we lost a great
many valiant soldiers, with four
officers, e’er we could break through,
which at last was effected with considerable
loss. A second order was
sent to the general of the Corps de
reserve to pursue, but in this two he
is said to have strangely neglected his
duty, pleading that he did not know
the <i>roads</i>. However the enemy retreated,
in some disorder, and with as
considerable a loss.</p>

<p>After having gained as compleat
a victory as so stout a resistance could
admit of, he determined to avail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
himself of those advantages generally
resulting from conquest: He in
consequence of this, disposed the
troops in such a manner as to secure
all the passes, and to prevent surprize.
A more compleat and brilliant
victory would have undoubtedly
gained over the black Cats, had the
general complied with his orders,
without hesitation, and therefore his
case being taken into consideration,
he was divested of all his employments
and honours, which at that
time was for some reasons of state
thought a sufficient disgrace, tho’
not an adequate punishment.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">A Cat and nine-tails is so well
known to the common soldiers
and sailors that we need not describe
it to them, we shall only say, that it
is generally appointed for the punishment
of delinquents: It is called a
Cat and nine-tails, because a Cat is
a vindictive creature, and is supposed
to have as many lives as the number
of the Muses, but why the number
nine should be affixed either to this
mastix, or those ladies of antiquity,
we shall by no means take up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
reader’s time in enquiring, but shall
reserve that, among many other invaluable
arcana, to ourselves.</p>

<p>We shall however take notice,
that this vindictive mastix, this flaggellum,
called a Cat and nine-tails
is applied to the back, which shews
its original intention, however since
unworthily perverted to meaner
punishments, was to chastise cowardice,
or disobedience of orders,
because tergiversation or turning the
back is an act of cowardice and
disobedience.</p>

<p>Had a common soldier been guilty
of a manifest neglect or break of
duty, we are not sure if one like the
above-mentioned general would not
have ordered the <i>Cat and nine-tails</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
to be applied to the offending party,
but so it is that,</p>

<p>I remember to have been once in
<i>G——r</i>, and perhaps some of my
readers might have been there at the
same time (in the year 1746) where
I saw a common centinel receive
five hundred strokes of the <i>Cat and
nine-tails</i> for killing his own pig;
worthy reader be not surprized, for
in the same year captain P——n
was broke by the same governor,
for having bought a fish. The
governor was afterwards broke himself,
but he snapt his fingers at the
disgrace, having by all manner of oppression
(for he was sole merchant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
baker, brewer, chandler, shoe-maker,
&amp;c. himself) amassed a fortune of
sixty thousand pounds during his
short government; but the poor
centinel never received a sixpence
for the five hundred injuries he received
from the Cat and nine-tails.</p>

<p>Our hero having finished his campaign
with success and glory, was
one day watching under a farmer’s
stack of corn, to take as many mice,
as he could detect in their rapine;
which was not unobserved by the
house-dog, who being accustomed
himself to such slaughter, on the
pulling down the stacks, judged this
to be an invasion of his rights and
privileges. <i>Tom</i> had killed above a
dozen, of which he had breakfasted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
upon seven, when Roger the house-dog
came on him unawares, and invested
his sides in such a manner,
and began to worry him so terribly,
that our hero, strong as he was,
found himself almost at the mercy
of his huge assailant.—Tom’s cries
brought to his assistance three of the
stoutest cats in the village, who attacking
the nose of <i>Roger</i>, did so
lacerate that, and the adjacent mouth
and nose, that his yelling reached
the ears of his master, who came
time enough to disengage him from
their talons. Roger, finding himself
at liberty, would have run at our
hero a second time, but our hero
stood his ground spiting at him, and
raising his back (on which the hairs
stood erect, like a grove of spears)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
to an uncommon elevation. The
farmer, seeing the resolution of this
gigantic stranger, admired his intrepidity,
and beating in the dog, attempted
to wheedle our hero, who,
on receiving such civil treatment
from one he had never seen, and
who had interposed between him
and danger, advanced up to him in a
gait truly courteous and graceful.
The farmer went before, and Tom
followed with all the humility of an
invited guest. The farmer’s wife
seeing a great huge cat all bloody,
and its hairs almost torn from off its
back, asked her husband in a very uncouth
tone of voice, what galligaskin
of a bear was that he had brought
home with him; ’tis a fine cat, replied
the husband, and such a galligaskin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
as had like to have killed
your Roger; here Ruth, says he, calling
the dairy-maid, get him some
new milk, for the poor devil has had
a dev’lish bout on’t. He or Roger
would have died on the spot, e’re
either of e’m would have given it
up; two such are not in the whole
world besides, except my birchen
cock, and switch the greyhound;
I’ll match the four against the four
winds: I suppose, said the gentle
dame, you’ll bring your plough-horses
in the house next; you’re
become the jest of the parish already
with your <i>birchen-poles</i>, your greyhounds,
your horses, and your
matches. Is the Cat to run a race
next? See what the ’squire will say
to you, when your rent comes to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
paid; cocking and horse-racing will
pay three hundred a year to be sure,
and poaching will make a gentleman
of you. Hold your busy tongue,
says he, what was we before the
last hard year? Were we worth a
brass farthing, till corn grew dear?
shew me e’re a farmer of e’m all has
made a better hand on’t. The
’squire! Don’t tell me of the ’squire—what
has he left out of fifteen hundred
a year—have not I lent him
from time to time seven hundred
pounds on the west fields; and now
he wants five hundred more on the
great marsh to go to Newmarket—Rent!
Why dy’e talk to me of rent?
Or what is three hundred a year to
me,—come, come, I dont forget, if
you do—when you was glad to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
millk the cows, and do the drudgery
of the steward’s house, and when I
was no more, than <i>Joe</i> the ploughman—now,
d’ye see, I’m another
man, and you’re another woman—Hea’en
send us another hard year—and
then we’re made for ever.
Come, come, whatever pets I have,
I lose nothing by e’m dy’e see, and so
take care of the stranger—Ruth—wash
him from the blood, and I dare
say he has a fine coat. <i>Ruth</i> did as
she was ordered,—she gave our hero
a large bowl of new milk, which he
stood in great need of, having lived
on rapine and plunder like other
soldiers, ever since he quitted <i>Dolly
Tinder</i>. But this rule of obedience
was not the only reason why <i>Ruth</i>
loved Cats above all things; there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
were other motives for the extraordinary
pains she took in trimming,
and feeding our distressed hero. She
loved Cats, because her mistress hated
them; she loved sports, because her
master was fond of them; but above
all, she loved ev’ry thing that her
mistress hated, because she hated her
mistress: The farmer and she had
got between them several sons and
daughters, and old <i>Jane</i> his wife
was an old maid, twelve years
since—Ruth was fruitful; a quality
much admired by the tillers of
ground, especially to those, who
deal in corn; honest <i>Joe</i> loved
young <i>Ruth</i>, much better than he did
old <i>Jane</i>, because young <i>Ruth</i>’s
children, which were numerous,
were also very serviceable to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
farm, and were likely to promote
his intrests by the income of their
labour; <i>Ruth</i> had been the refuge
of the ’squire, from whom she descended
to the ploughman <i>Joe</i>;
when a young girl, she was old
<i>Jane</i>’s superior, and during the time
of her being the ’squire’s mistress,
received many a low curt’sy from
her <i>new</i> mistress. These were the
springs of action, and the motives of
particulars, which swayed in this
family; so that old <i>Jane</i> had little
more power in the house, than the
power of her tongue, which she was
determined not to part with, as she
thought it was the last prerogative a
wife <i>should</i> part with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>When she had washed, combed,
and fed <i>Tom</i>, she introduced him;
at first sight <i>Jane</i> could not believe
her eyes, and when he came to pay
his court to her, she condescended to
stroke him, saying, now you may
keep your pets to yourselves,—this
shall be my pet for the future,—take
you no trouble about him; for
of all the creatures I ever set my
eyes on, dogs, or Cats, horses, or
hounds, game-cocks, or what not,
this Cat exceeds every thing, and I
hope you’ll not be running to my
lady, to make her fall in love with
it, and then give it away, for I’m
determined never to part with it,—Ruth,
see is it a he, or a she,—but
no matter, I’ll keep it as long as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
will stay with me; and what shall we
call it <i>Joe</i>? Well, well, says <i>Joe</i>, if
you like him take him, and call him
what you please, you know the dog’s
called Roger, so as this is of the better
sort, give him a name yourself,—suppose
you call him <i>Prince</i>, for I
love Prince <i>Ferdinand</i>, tho’ he be a
<i>Hanoverian</i>: Then <i>Prince</i> let him be,
said old Jane, for sure he is the <i>prince</i>
of Cats. <i>Tom</i>, tho’ he knew his
own name better, was no way
ashamed pf this new title of loyalty
bestowed on him; but indeed he was
too much tired to pay any great attention
to the encomiums which
were paid him, he therefore laid
himself down by the fire-side and
stretched his uncommon length, beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
the feet of his new mistress,
entirely resigned to his present condition.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he, without
paying any ceremony, either to the
great house-dog, who only growl’d
at him, or to a little sheep cur-dog,
who run away from him, took a
circuit of the house; he first reconnoitred
the kitchen, smelt to every
thing, and among the rest retired
into the cole-hole, for reasons we do
not think decent to mention. However,
as he knew, when he was
clean, he took care not to dirty his
coat, or even his paws, because he
found there a large quantity of saw-dust,
where he performed his lucubrations.
He then went up stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
searched ev’ry room, and next proceeded
to the garret, where an object,
which he had never before seen,
presented itself to his view. He
walked round it, and round it, eyeing
it with uncommon curiosity.—He
smelt to it, and found something in
the scent, with which he though
himself very well acquainted, yet
could he not conceive, for his life,
what connection this machine had
with the well-known smell.—At
length he sat him down squat, as it
were to ponder upon this new
phœnomenon; after many ejaculations
he could make nothing of it,
and so retired into a dark closet to
reconnoitre its contents. While he
was smelling about there, he heard
a sudden noise, and going to see what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
it was, observed a mouse hanging by
the neck in the machine: He then
began to <i>smell a rat</i>, and is said to
have made the following meditation,
in imitation of Swift’s, on a broom-stick.</p>


<h3 class="lsp0"><i>A</i> Cat’<i>s meditation on a mouse-trap</i>.</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">By what name to call thee I know
not, but the use, to which thou
art destined, is evident as a mouse-hole;
and who will after trust man?
Are Cats so scarce, that their proferr’d
service stinks.—Suppose the
whole race extinct, would this admirable
engine destroy the race of
mice.—Can this machine smell them
out, follow them to their dark recesses,
sit over them, till they pop out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
their heads, and then put them to
the slaughter? The structure is indeed
a proof of human ingenuity,
but is it not also that of their ingratitude,
and is thus the feline services
repaid? If men lay snares and
gins for the vermin, which infest
them, to what use are Cats created?</p>

<p>Suppose a creature to exist who
lived upon fleas and lice, would it
not be cruel to interpose between
him and his prey, by the invention
of wiles to take them:—Every one
to his occupation.—That man
should boast himself on the notable
discovery of a piece of wood fabricated
for such mean and ungenerous
purposes! It is a monopoly, contrary
to the nature and reason of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
things, to substitute an inanimate
piece of wood instead of a living
creature, made and intended for the
purpose. I will never <i>mouse</i> more,
let ungenerous man kill his own
vermin, and invent ways and means
to bring them to his baits. I have
done with it and him, who thus
plays <i>Cat</i> and <i>pan</i> with one of
the most useful domestics he entertains.</p>

<p>Thus saying he struck the <i>mouse-trap</i>
about the room with indignation,
and went down stairs in the
sullens.—However he was beloved
by every body that knew him, this
affair struck him to the heart, and
he loathed the very victuals that
were brought to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>One day as he happened to be
traversing the purlieus of the village,
he saw a great number of
mouse-traps lying in a window for
<i>sale</i>. He recollected the form of
the machine, and no doubt, judged
rightly, that they were made there;
upon this discovery, he went in the
dusk of the evening, and by a most
vociferous exertion of his voice, he
summoned three-score <i>Cats</i> about
him, who were curious to know the
cause of this citation.</p>

<p>Tom was not long relating the
occasion, and after having held a
short conference with the gravest
and most sagacious, he appointed
the hour and place of assignation,
which was at the <i>mouse-trap</i>-maker’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
house between the hours of twelve
and one at night.—They met according
to appointment, when all
the house was asleep, and he shewed
the machines, at the same time
interpreting the use of them to his
brethren, and the next thing that
came upon the tapis, was what to
do with them, how to dispose of
them, and in fine how to destroy
them; and the result of this short
conference was to burn them on the
spot; they accordingly gathered the
chips and shavings that lay about
the shop, and dragging about two
hundred of them, which were
finished, they in an hour’s time set
fire to them all; as their was a fire
in the shop it was easily done by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
sixty Cats, who were as busy as
their indignation could make them,
nor did they much care whether
they set the house on fire as
they detested every thing in it,
both the house and the master.—But
as the business was very hot
so did it over heat several Cats, who
died of fevers, contracted by that
nights ferment; and among the rest
our hero fell sick that night, and
tho’ all proper care was taken to
recover him, he died the third day
of his sickness, being in the year
1759, and on the 18th of September,
near two months after the
glorious victory obtained by him
in his troops, and in the second
year of his age, untimely cut off
in the bloom of life. He was decently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
interred in the garden, and
tho’ no monument was erected to
his memory, we hope this our respectable
history will transmit his
name to the latest posterity.</p>
